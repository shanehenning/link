#### Project Description

### Project Description

Supporting sick or injured people is an important part of building community. In this Service-Learning Project, students will identify organizations in the community that help sick or injured people, then investigate ways they can support these organizations and the people they serve (for example, with a sympathy card!&amp;-&amp;!writing campaign or a donation drive). Finally, students will create and execute a plan based on their research.

If this project has been done before, students can use previous ideas as examples if they need help.

Project Steps
#### Investigation
Have students identify organizations in the community that support sick or injured people, either on their own or from a list you provide. Then have students contact the organizations to find out what they can do to support them.
#### Planning
Once the students have identified an organization and what they'll do to help, they'll create a plan for providing the support the organization needs. This plan should include setting goals and timelines, and assigning roles and tasks to specific students.
#### Action
Students will put their plan into action. They'll determine the timeline or refer to the schedule part of the plan and begin. They'll also check the schedule frequently to ensure everyone is on task and meeting milestones.
#### Reflection
Students will reflect on what they've learned throughout this process, how what they did helped or encouraged sick or injured people in the community, what challenges they faced, and how they overcame these challenges.
#### Demonstration
If the students have chosen to do something that can be observed (such as delivering toys during the holidays), have them invite friends, family, and community members to observe them completing the project. Otherwise, have students create a presentation about their project for school staff, peers, or community members.
