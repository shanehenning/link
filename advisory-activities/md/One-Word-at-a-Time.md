#### Introduction
Present the activity: **Today you're going to work in groups to think of ways you can help friends solve conflictsâ€”but there's a twist. You won't be talking about what to do; you'll collaboratively write it down by taking turns writing one word at a time.**
#### Steps
1. Assign each group a space on the whiteboard, or hand out a sheet of paper and markers to each group.
2. Have each group decide on the type of conflict they'll write about (for example, a relationship, money, respect, or sports) and put it in the designated space.
3. Have one person in each group write down a word to start a sentence about how to help friends resolve the conflict.
4. Have the next person in the group write down a word that continues the sentence. Have students continue adding words one at a time until the group has written a full sentence.
5. Have the groups continue with additional sentences, as time allows.
6. Have students quietly read what each group came up with.

#### Reflection
1. Have the class reflect quietly about the following prompt:

**What's one idea you see here that you might be willing to try?**
2. Call on students to tell the class their ideas, as time allows.
