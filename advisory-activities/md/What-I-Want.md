-  **What's something you want to achieve in your life?**

-  **What's something you want to achieve this year?**

-  **What's something you want to achieve today?**

-  **What are some obstacles that might make it difficult for you to achieve your goals?**
#### Reflection

**Who else has a goal similar to yours? How can you help each other achieve your shared goal?**
