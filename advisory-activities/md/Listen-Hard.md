#### Introduction
Present the activity: **Listening when your friends talk seems easy, but really focusing on someone and hearing what that person is saying can be hard. Today we're going to play a game to practice our listening skills. And who knows? If you get good at listening when your friends talk, they may return the favor and listen to you!**
#### Steps
1. Explain the rules:
2. Have students do a couple of practice rounds in their groups.
3. Hold an elimination round. The winner from each group will come to the front of the class and compete for the championship.
4. Hold the championship round. The winner of this round is the champion listener!

#### Reflection
1. Have the class reflect quietly about the following prompt:

**What was hard about this game? What strategies did you use to make it easier?**
2. Call on students to tell the class their ideas, as time allows.
