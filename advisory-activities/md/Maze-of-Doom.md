#### Introduction
Present the activity: **Today you'll get to help each other traverse the MAZE of DOOM! Each of you will work with a partner. One at a time, one person from each pair will go through the maze while blindfolded. If you touch any obstacle in the maze, you're immediately out. Your partner will stand outside the maze and tell you what you need to do to avoid touching anything, but he or she can't touch you. I'll time you. The pair that gets the blindfolded member through the maze fastest wins.**
#### Steps
1. Have each pair of students decide who will go through the maze and who will be the helper.
2. Rearrange the room to create a maze of obstacles.
3. Blindfold the students who will go through the maze.
4. One at a time, have each blindfolded student go through the maze with the help of his or her partner. Time how long it takes for each student to get all the way through.
5. The fastest pair of students are the champions of the maze!
6. Have partners switch roles and repeat Steps 3 to 5.

#### Reflection
1. Have the class reflect quietly about the following prompt:

**What did it feel like to have to rely on your partner for help? What did it feel like to have your partner rely on you for help?**
2. Call on students to tell the class their ideas, as time allows.
