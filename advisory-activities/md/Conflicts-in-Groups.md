As a class, discuss one or more of the following prompts, as time allows:


-  **Why is it important to be able to work together in groups?**

-  **Tell us about a time there was a conflict between members of a group you were a part of. How was the group affected?**

-  **What are some things you can do to help resolve a conflict in a group you're in?**
#### Reflection
Have the class reflect quietly about the following prompt:

**We don't always get to pick the people we're in groups with. What's something you can do to make it easier to work with people you may not get along with?**

Call on students to tell the class their ideas, as time allows.
