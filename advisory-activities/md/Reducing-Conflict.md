#### Project Description

### Project Description

Conflicts are a fact of life, including at school. Helping reduce the number of conflicts students get into and helping them resolve conflicts peacefully contributes to a safe and supportive school community.

In this Service-Learning Project, students will identify how conflicts arise at school, and some ways they can help support others who are experiencing a conflict (for example, creating a list of mediators, starting an awareness campaign about a particular type of conflict, or making posters to remind students what to do when conflict happens). Finally, students will take the necessary steps to support their peers who are involved in conflicts.

If this project has been done before, students will build on the work started in previous years.

Project Steps
#### Investigation
First, have students identify common causes of conflict at school. Then have them investigate ways to support other students who are involved in conflicts. This support can be preventive—helping stop conflicts before they start—or it can involve helping students resolve active conflicts peacefully. This can be accomplished in a number of ways, including:


-  Class brainstorm

-  Interviewing students, teachers, and other staff members

-  Researching conflict resolution strategies

Then have students work with each other and school staff to decide what they'll do to help reduce conflicts and build a safe and supportive school community.
#### Planning
Once students have decided what actions they want to take to reduce conflicts at school, they'll create a plan for how to accomplish the project. This plan should include setting goals and timelines, and assigning roles and tasks to specific students.
#### Action
Students will put their plan into action. They'll determine the timeline or refer to the schedule part of the plan and begin. They'll also check the schedule frequently to ensure everyone is on task and meeting milestones.
#### Reflection
Students will reflect on what they've learned throughout this process, how what they've done will help everyone at school, what challenges they faced, and how they overcame these challenges.
#### Demonstration
If the students have chosen to do something that can be observed (such as playing a public service announcement for the school), have them invite friends, family, and community members to observe them completing the project. Otherwise, have students create a presentation about their project for school staff or community members.
