Class Meeting Instructions
#### Warm-Up
Have everyone in the class (including you!) briefly answer the following question: 

**Habits can be positive or negative. Name one positive habit you have. **<br/>
            (Brushing my teeth. Calling my parents when I get somewhere. Eating breakfast. Finishing homework on time.)
#### Discussion
As a class, discuss one or more of the following prompts, as time allows:


-  **Tell about a good habit you have and how you established that habit. How long did it take you? Did you need any help?**

-  **How can positive habits help you achieve a goal?**

-  **What are some negative habits people can have? How can negative habits make it harder to achieve your goals?**
#### Reflection
Have the class reflect quietly about the following prompt:

**Think of a goal you have. What's one new habit you'd like to establish that will help you meet that goal?**

Call on students to tell the class their ideas, as time allows.
