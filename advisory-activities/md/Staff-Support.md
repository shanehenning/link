#### Preparation

2. If this project has been done before, have a list ready of examples of ways to help the support staff that students can refer to if they need ideas.

#### Project Description

### Project Description

Support staff—such as custodians, office managers, bus drivers, and IT staff—are key members of the school community, but the importance of their work is not always obvious to students. Investigating what these people do and exploring ways to acknowledge and assist them is a great way to build a positive school community.

In this Service-Learning Project, students will identify the things support staff do every day to keep the school running, and the skills they use to do their jobs well. Then students will investigate ways they can acknowledge and assist support staff members (for example, volunteering to help, starting an awareness campaign for a particular issue, or making posters that show their gratitude and appreciation). Finally, students will take the necessary steps to assist these staff members in the ways they have identified.

If this project has been done before, students can use previous ideas as examples if they need help.

Project Steps
#### Investigation
Have students identify the things support staff do every day to keep the school running, and the skills they use to do their jobs well. Students can create this list in a number of ways, including:


-  Class brainstorm

-  Interviewing support staff members and teachers

-  Asking students in different classes for their opinions and ideas

-  Researching job descriptions online
#### Planning
Students will create a plan for:


-  Identifying ways they can acknowledge and assist school support staff based on their investigation of what the staff members do (for example, doing things to make their jobs easier, helping them with their work, or showing appreciation for the work they do)

-  Determining the steps they'll take to help the support staff, such as volunteering, making encouraging posters, or starting an awareness campaign

-  Creating a schedule and assigning people to complete each part of the project
#### Action
Students will put their plan into action. They'll determine the timeline or refer to the schedule part of the plan and begin. They'll also check the schedule frequently to ensure everyone is on task and meeting milestones.
#### Reflection
Students will reflect on what they've learned throughout this process, how what they did will help others at school, what challenges they faced, and how they overcame these challenges.
#### Demonstration
Students will ultimately help out the support staff they identified during their investigation. If possible, have students formally present to each other which staff members they helped and how.
