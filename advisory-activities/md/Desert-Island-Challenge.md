#### Introduction
Present the activity: **Each of your groups is stranded on a separate desert island. But you get to choose four items from this list to help you survive. **
#### Steps
1. Show students the list below, or use your own.
2. Explain the rules:
            
You'll be taking turns choosing items from the list. Your group gets to choose one item per turn.
When it's your group's turn to choose, you'll have 15 seconds to agree on the item. If you can't choose in 15 seconds, you lose your turn.
After an item is selected, I'll cross it off the list, and it can't be chosen by another group.
3. Have one group choose the first item. Have the groups continue to take turns until all groups have chosen four items.
4. Have each group describe how the items they chose will help them survive on the desert island.

#### Reflection
1. Have the class reflect quietly about the following prompt:

**What emotions did you feel when your group was trying to decide which items to choose? How did you handle those emotions?**
2. Call on students to tell the class their ideas, as time allows.
