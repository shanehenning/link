#### Warm-Up
Have everyone in the class (including you!) briefly answer the following question:

**Think of a close friend. What three words would that person use to describe you?**

(Funny. Quiet. Athletic.)
#### Discussion
As a class, discuss one or more of the following prompts, as time allows:


-  **Do these words reflect your values, or are they very different?**

-  **How do your values affect the decisions you make about your friends?**

-  **Agree or disagree: "My friends and I get along because we share values." Explain your thinking.**
#### Reflection
Have the class reflect quietly about the following prompt:

**What's one goal you've set for this year? How can your values help you reach that goal?**

Call on students to tell the class their ideas, as time allows.
