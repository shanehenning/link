Class Meeting Instructions
#### Warm-Up
Have everyone in the class (including you!) briefly answer the following question: 

**Have you ever witnessed people being mean online? Have you ever joined in?**
#### Discussion
As a class, discuss one or more of the following prompts, as time allows:


-  **Tell us about a time you witnessed someone getting picked on online. What happened and what caused it to stop?**

-  **Online bullying is when someone keeps being mean to someone else on purpose online. How can the effects of bullying be amplified when they happen online?**

-  **Who can you go to for help if you witness online bullying? Why would you go to that person?**
#### Reflection
Have the class reflect quietly about the following prompt:

**Many times, people bully others online because they think they're anonymous and no one will know who they are. In reality, nothing you do online is ever really anonymous. What do you think could happen to people who are discovered to be secretly bullying others online?**

Call on students to tell the class their ideas, as time allows.
