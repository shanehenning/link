#### Project Description

### Project Description

Getting involved in important local, national, or international issues can help students recognize that they have the ability to make the world a better place. In this Service-Learning Project, students will identify and investigate a pressing local, national, or international cause that's important to them and develop a plan to aid that cause.

Individual classes can adopt their own causes, or multiple classes can work together to adopt a single cause. If this project has been done before, students can refer to previous projects as examples.

Project Steps
#### Investigation
Students will begin by creating a list of local, national, or international issues they think are important. Then students will adopt a single cause they think they can help. Students should also investigate which organizations are currently engaged in helping their adopted cause, and what kind of help those organizations need.
#### Planning
Students will create a plan for helping their adopted cause. They will choose one they'd like to help, investigate organizations that focus on this cause, and identify what kind of help is needed (for example, raising awareness, gathering materials, or fundraising), making sure to follow any guidelines or parameters the organization provides. Students will also need to identify peers, staff, and community members who are available to help. Finally, students will need to create a schedule and assign people to complete each part of the project.
#### Action
Students will put their plan into action. They'll determine the timeline or refer to the schedule part of the plan and begin. They'll also check the schedule frequently to ensure everyone is on task and meeting milestones.
#### Reflection
Students will reflect on what they've learned throughout this process, what their successes and challenges were, and how they've helped their community.
#### Demonstration
Give students the opportunity to formally present their project to a larger audience (for example, at an assembly, or in a documentary posted on the school or district website), and describe how they went about creating it.
