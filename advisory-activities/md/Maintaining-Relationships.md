#### Warm-Up
Have everyone in the class (including you!) briefly answer the following question:

**Imagine your ideal friend. What is this friend's personality like? What values does this friend have?**

(My ideal friend is smart, kind, and values honesty. My ideal friend is spontaneous and values curiosity.)
#### Discussion
As a class, discuss one or more of the following prompts, as time allows:


-  **Can a real-life relationship ever be ideal?**

-  **What are some challenges that happen in relationships, even positive ones?**

-  **Have you ever had to work hard to keep a friend? Why did you put effort into it?**

-  **How do you know when it's not worth putting more time and effort into a relationship?**
#### Reflection
Have the class reflect quietly about the following prompt:

**If you were to get into an argument with one of your friends tomorrow, what would you do to resolve the conflict and maintain the friendship?**

Call on students to tell the class their ideas, as time allows.
