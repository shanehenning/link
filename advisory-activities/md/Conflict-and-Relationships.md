#### Warm-Up
Have everyone in the class (including you!) briefly answer the following question:

**What are some possible effects of being involved in a conflict, both bad and good?**
#### Discussion
As a class, discuss one or more of the following prompts, as time allows:


-  **Think of a serious conflict you've had with a friend. How did it change your relationship with that person?**

-  **How could that conflict have been avoided?**

-  **If you just try hard enough, is it possible to avoid all conflicts with friends? Why or why not?**

-  **What's a reason someone might choose to start a conflict with a friend?**
#### Reflection
Have the class reflect quietly about the following prompt:

**Think of a friend of yours and imagine he or she is trying to start a conflict with you. How would you respond and why?**

Call on students to tell the class their ideas, as time allows.
