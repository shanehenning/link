Activity Instructions
#### Introduction
Present the activity: **Research shows that If!&amp;-&amp;!Then Plans make achieving goals much easier. It's not enough to just make plans, though. You also need to review them regularly so they get hardwired into your brain. When you're done with this activity, you'll have a notebook where you can write your If!&amp;-&amp;!Then Plans.**
#### Steps
1. Hand out materials to students. If students are making their own notebooks, provide time to assemble them.
2. Have students divide their notebooks into two sections, Academics and Social Life, and have them identify one academic goal and one social goal they want to achieve.
3. Have students create If–Then Plans for achieving each of their goals. Remind students that in an If–Then Plan:

**If** is a specific cue you can react to quickly.

**Then** is a specific action or actions you can do immediately.
4. Have students use the following format:

**Goal:** ________________________________________

**If (or when):** ________________________________________,

**Then:** ________________________________________.
5. (Optional) Write a sample plan on the board using the format in Step 4.
6. Call on volunteers to share one of their If–Then Plans with the class.

#### Reflection
1. Have the class reflect quietly about the following prompt:

**Reviewing your If!&amp;-&amp;!Then Plans is the only way to hardwire them into your brain. How can you make sure you review your plans regularly?**
2. Call on students to tell the class their ideas, as time allows.
