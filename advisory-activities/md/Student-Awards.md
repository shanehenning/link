2. If this project has been done before, have example awards or award categories for students to reference.

#### Project Description

### Project Description

Showing recognition is an important part of building community and making other people feel appreciated. One way to show recognition is to create awards—both academic and social-emotional—for younger students at school.

In this Service-Learning Project, students will identify areas in which younger students deserve recognition (for example, friendliest award, hardest worker award, or most helpful award). Then students will investigate what awards teachers and staff think should be presented to younger students. Finally, they will choose recipients for the awards, create certificates, and present them to students who were selected based on merit.

If this project has been done before, students can use previous awards as examples if they need ideas.

Project Steps
#### Investigation
Students will identify award categories that are good for promoting academic and social-emotional success, and then create awards in these categories for younger students. This can be accomplished in a number of ways, including:


-  Class brainstorm

-  Interviewing teachers, other staff members, or peers

-  Polling students in different classes

-  Researching online

If students identify an overwhelming number of award categories, they may have to prioritize them and choose the most important ones to create award certificates for.
#### Planning
Students will create a plan for identifying the award categories they'll use. They'll also have to decide what awards they'll ultimately give out, who they'll give the awards to, and how they'll produce the certificates (for example, pen and paper or printed document). Finally, they'll need to assign people to complete each part of the project.
#### Action
Students will put their plan into action. They'll determine the timeline or refer to the schedule part of the plan and begin. They'll also check the schedule frequently to ensure everyone is on task and meeting milestones.
#### Reflection
Students will reflect on what they've learned throughout this process, how what they've done will help younger students feel recognized, what challenges they faced, and how they overcame these challenges.
#### Demonstration
Students will write or type and print their award certificates and present them to the students they chose. If possible, give students the opportunity to present these awards at an assembly and allow them to explain why they awarded the certificates to the students they did.
