#### Introduction
Present the activity: **Today you're going to work with a partner to explore things that are similar and different about you. The only rule is that you can't name obvious school-related things, like being in the same or different classes.**
#### Steps
1. Have partners stand about 5 feet apart from each other. Explain the rules:
2. Have students start identifying similarities and differences, and taking steps toward or away from each other accordingly. When most of the pairs have started to get close to each other, stop the game.
3. Have the class compare the similarities and differences they identified, explaining which were easier to identify and why.

#### Reflection
1. Have the class reflect quietly about the following prompt:

**It's easy to spot differences between people, but it's sometimes harder to spot similarities. How could taking the time to identify the similarities between you and other people help you avoid conflicts?**
2. Call on students to tell the class their ideas, as time allows.
