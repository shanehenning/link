#### Introduction
Present the activity: **A first impression is what you think about someone when you meet that person for the first time. Today we're going to explore our first impressions of each other.**
#### Steps
1. Have each student write his or her name at the top of a sheet of paper.
2. Collect the papers and shuffle them.
3. Redistribute the papers, making sure each student has someone else's paper.
4. Have students write down their first positive impression of the person whose name is at the top of the paper.
5. Repeat Steps 2 to 4, as time allows.
6. Return the papers to their owners. Have each student read his or her favorite first impression to the class.

#### Reflection
1. Have the class reflect quietly about the following prompt:

**How did others' first impressions compare to how you see yourself? Why do you think they're similar or different?**
2. Call on students to tell the class their ideas, as time allows.
