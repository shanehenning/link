#### Introduction
Present the activity: **Today you'll be participating in a poetry slam. As a class, you'll pick an important issue that you all have an opinion about. Then each of you will write a poem and perform it for the class.**
#### Steps
1. Have the class agree on an important issue to write about. This can be school-focused (for example, peer pressure, fitting in, or a difficult class) or community-focused (for example, inequality or pressure to succeed).
2. Have each student write a poem expressing his or her opinion about the issue. Students may choose the format of their poems, or you can choose a format for the class to follow.
3. Collect the finished poems and redistribute them randomly to students.
4. Have students read the poems they received to the class.

#### Reflection
1. Have the class reflect quietly about the following prompt:

**How did it feel to perform someone else's poem? Was it easy or difficult to represent a different perspective from your own? Why or why not?**
2. Call on students to tell the class their ideas, as time allows.
