#### Project Description

### Project Description

Violence and conflict in the community are difficult for everyone, but they can have an especially big impact on youth. Helping young people resolve conflict and violence is a great way to build a more positive community.

In this Service-Learning Project, students will identify the effects conflict and violence have on young people. Then students will investigate ways they can help support young people in the community who are experiencing conflict and violence (for example, by creating posters advocating for peace or reaching out to local politicians for ideas). Finally, students will take steps to support young people in the community.

Project Steps
#### Investigation
First, have students identify possible causes of conflict in the community, and the effects it may have on young people. This list can be created in a number of ways, including:


-  Class brainstorm

-  Interviewing community members or local service organizations

-  Researching the effects that living with conflict can have on young people's academic and social development 

Then have students work with community organizations to identify what they can do to help support youth in the community who are experiencing conflict and violence.
#### Planning
Once students have decided what actions they want to take to support young people in the community, they'll create a plan for how to accomplish the project. This plan should include setting goals and timelines, and assigning roles and tasks to specific students.
#### Action
Students will put their plan into action. They'll determine the timeline or refer to the schedule part of the plan and begin. They'll also check the schedule frequently to ensure everyone is on task and meeting milestones.
#### Reflection
Students will reflect on what they've learned throughout this process, how what they've done will help youth in the community who are experiencing conflict, what challenges they faced, and how they overcame these challenges.
#### Demonstration
If the students have chosen to do something that can be observed (such as creating a mural), have them invite friends, family, and community members to observe them completing the project. Otherwise, have students create a presentation about their project for school staff or community members.
