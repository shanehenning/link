#### Introduction
Present the activity: **Today you're going to think about the kind of person you used to be when you were younger. First you'll write a brief description of your younger self on a note card. Then we'll draw note cards at random and try to guess who wrote each description.**

2. Have students think of at least three ways they've changed since they were younger and write a brief description of their younger selves.
3. Collect the descriptions.
4. Randomly choose cards, one at a time. Read each description aloud and try to guess as a class who it describes.

#### Reflection

**Which description surprised you the most? Why were you so surprised?**
2. Call on students to tell the class their ideas, as time allows.
