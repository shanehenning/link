#### Introduction
Present the activity: **Today we're going to get to know each other better and appreciate experiences we've had that made us feel certain emotions.**
#### Steps
1. Have students stand in a circle. Give students 1 small piece of tape to mark their beginning spots. Have them stick the tape to the floor.
2. Explain the rules:

**One person will start in the center of the circle. That person is "it." The center of the circle doesn't have a piece of tape.**
3. Have the person in the center of the circle start by saying,

**"The warm wind blows for anyone who feels . . ."** and finish by adding an emotion and a situation in which a person might feel that emotion (for example, "The warm wind blows for anyone who feels happy when it's sunny outside"). See the list below for possible statement starters.
4. Have students who don't feel that emotion in that situation (for example, students who don't feel happy when it's sunny outside) continue to stand in the same spot.
5. Have students who do feel that emotion in that situation walk slowly to another place around the circle, at least two spots away from where they started. This includes the person in the middle, who should try to find a spot on the edge of the circle at a piece of tape.
6. Once everyone has moved, one person will be left without a piece of tape to stand on. He or she becomes "it" and moves to the middle. Continue the game, as time allows.

#### Reflection
1. Have the class reflect quietly about the following prompt:

**What did you notice about your feelings about certain things compared to others in the class?**
2. Call on students to tell the class their ideas, as time allows.
