#### Preparation
1. Identify people at school (students or staff) who are willing to help, and whom students can use as resources in their investigation.
2. If multiple classes are collaborating, plan time for them to come together to work.
3. If this project has been done before, have a copy of the old directory ready for students to refer to. Make note of any students or staff who are no longer at the school.

#### Project Description

### Project Description

Participating in extracurricular activities, both in and outside of school, can significantly improve students' academic success. In this Service-Learning Project, students will investigate the extracurricular activities available to them at school and in the community, and create a directory listing these activities to use throughout the year. Individual classes can create their own directories, or multiple classes can work together to create a single directory for all students to use.

If this project has been done before, students can revise and update the old directory.

Project Steps
#### Investigation
Students should begin the project by identifying a diverse list of activities that students at school are interested in. This can include sports, games, and hobbies, as well as activities like community service. The list doesn't have to be limited to formal teams and clubs, and can include informal groups of students formed around a specific interest, such as music or skateboarding. Students should also decide what kind of information about the activities they need to gather (for example, how to join, when the group meets, and how much it costs to participate).
#### Planning
Students will create a plan for:


-  Identifying specific teams, clubs, organizations, and groups students can join

-  Gathering the information they need about each group or activity

-  Deciding on the format for the directory

-  How they'll produce the directory (for example, pen and paper, printed document, or website)

-  Whether they'll include visuals along with the text

-  Creating a schedule and assigning people to complete each part of the project
#### Action
Students will put their plan into action. They'll determine the timeline or refer to the schedule part of the plan and begin. They'll also check the schedule frequently to ensure everyone is on task and meeting milestones.
#### Reflection
Students will reflect on what they've learned throughout this process, what their successes and challenges were, and how they've helped their community.
#### Demonstration
Students will make their directory available for others to use (for example, by printing and distributing copies, or putting the directory up on the school website). If possible, give students the opportunity to present their directory formally to peers, staff, or families, and describe how they went about creating it.
