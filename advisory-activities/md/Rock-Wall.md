#### Introduction
Present the activity: **Each of you does interesting, positive, noteworthy things all the time. In short, you do things that rock. You may not realize it, but we see you when you do these awesome things. Today we're going to start building a class Rock Wall. Every time you see someone in this class do something that rocks—and it can be anywhere, not just in class—write a Rock on a Rock slip and add it to the wall. Let's see how high we can build this wall!**
#### Steps
1. Project the template below, or hand out premade Rock slips to each student.
2. Have each student create two Rocks to add to the Rock Wall. Make sure students are identifying actions other students have done, not just physical or personal traits they like.
3. Collect the Rocks, shuffle them, read them to the class, and post them at the base of the Rock Wall.
4. Allow time each week for students to add to the Rock Wall, building it upward as more Rocks are added. Encourage students to add more Rocks on their own time, too.

#### Reflection
1. Have the class reflect quietly about the following prompt:

**What did it feel like to recognize someone else for something positive he or she did?**
2. Call on students to tell the class their ideas, as time allows.
