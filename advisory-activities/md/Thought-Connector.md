#### Warm-Up
Have everyone in the class (including you!) briefly answer the following questions:

<li>
**Think of a strong emotion you experienced in the past 2 weeks. What was the emotion? What happened?**<br/>(Anger; my sister borrowed my clothes without asking. Embarrassment; I fell asleep in class.)
            </li>
<li>
**What thoughts were going through your head during that time?**<br/>
              (I thought that I hate my sister. I thought that everyone must be laughing at me.)
            </li>
#### Discussion
As a class, discuss one or more of the following prompts, as time allows:


-  **What calming-down strategies do you use and suggest that others try?**

-  **How can you help a friend who's feeling strong emotions?**

-  **Agree or disagree: "It's difficult to make decisions when I'm experiencing strong emotions." Explain your thinking.**
#### Reflection
Have the class reflect quietly about the following prompt:

**What's the most helpful thing you've learned about your own thoughts and emotions from the **Second Step** Program so far?**
