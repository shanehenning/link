Class Meeting Instructions
#### Warm-Up
Have everyone in the class (including you!) briefly answer the following question:

**Empathy is the ability to identify, understand, and respond thoughtfully to the feelings of others. Can you tell us about a time you were able to show empathy to someone else?**
#### Discussion
As a class, discuss one or more of the following prompts, as time allows:


-  **Tell us about a time you helped prevent or resolve a conflict by considering someone else's feelings.**

-  **How do you think considering someone else's feelings made the other person feel?**

-  **Tell us about a time someone showed empathy toward you when you were feeling angry, sad, or upset. What did this person do, and how did it affect the way you felt?**

-  **What can make it difficult to identify what someone else is feeling? How can you overcome those difficulties?**
#### Reflection
Have the class reflect quietly about the following prompt:

**Think of someone you know who you think might be feeling angry, sad, or upset right now. What's one thing you can do to help support that person?**

Call on students to tell the class their ideas, as time allows.
