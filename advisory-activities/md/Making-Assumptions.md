Class Meeting Instructions
#### Warm-Up
Have everyone in the class (including you!) briefly answer the following question: 

**What's an assumption people sometimes make about you before they get to know you?**<br/>
            (I play basketball. I'm not smart. I'm not from here.)
#### Discussion
As a class, discuss one or more of the following prompts, as time allows:


-  **Where do assumptions come from?**

-  **What's one way assumptions can affect our decisions?**

-  **What can we do to challenge assumptions and help people find out who we really are?**
#### Reflection
Have the class reflect quietly about the following prompt:

**What's an assumption you've made about someone else? What can you do to find out who that person really is?**

Call on students to tell the class their ideas, as time allows.
