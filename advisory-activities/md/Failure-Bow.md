#### Introduction
Present the activity: **Today we're going to learn and practice a technique to help us change how we react to failing and making mistakes. It's called the Failure Bow. **
#### Steps
1. Explain the rules:
            
Usually when we make a mistake, we feel bad, and our bodies reactâ€”we cringe, flinch, hesitate, or hide our faces. The Failure Bow is a technique to take that bad feeling and transform it so you can feel good about the mistake.
To do the bow, you'll fling your arms into the air (like a gymnast or trapeze artist does after landing), grin, and yell, "Woohoo! I failed!"
First we're going to practice the Failure Bow on our own and then we'll cheer for each other as we celebrate our mistakes.
2. Have students practice the Failure Bow 3 times:
            
Everyone stand up. Think of a mistake you made that you felt really bad about at the time. 
As your body begins to react negatively, throw your arms into the air, grin, and yell, "Woohoo! I failed!"
3. Have the 2 groups of students stand facing each other. Designate one group of students as the Performers and the other group as the Audience.
4. Have the Performers think of a mistake or failure that made them feel really bad, and on the count of 3, do the Failure Bow as a group.
5. Have the Audience clap loudly and cheer the Performers on as they celebrate their mistakes.
6. Have the groups of students switch roles and repeat Steps 4 and 5.

#### Reflection

2. Call on students to tell the class their ideas, as time allows.
