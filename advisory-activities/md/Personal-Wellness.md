#### Project Description

### Project Description

Learning how to practice personal wellness is an important part of being successful in school and in life. In this Service-Learning Project, students will first identify what the term wellness means to them (for example, physical, psychological, or emotional) and things they can do themselves to practice or promote it (for example, getting exercise, drinking water, practicing deep breathing, or stretching). Then they will investigate people, services, and practices that can help them maintain their wellness. Finally, students will create a resource, event, or program that advertises or advocates for the importance of personal wellness and wellness practices at school.

Individual classes can create their own projects, or multiple classes can work together to create a single project for all students. If this project has been done before, students can revise an old project to reflect new concerns, or use it as a reference when creating a new one.

Project Steps
#### Investigation
The class will create a list of practices or strategies that help maintain personal wellness. This list can be created in a number of ways, including:


-  Class brainstorm

-  Interviewing older students and/or staff

-  Polling students in different classes

Students will also investigate where they can go for information and guidance on the personal wellness practices and strategies they have identified.
#### Planning
Students will create a plan for identifying what people, strategies, and services are available to help them in practicing personal wellness. They may draw from their own experiences, interview other students and staff, or research what services or staff members are available to help at school or in the district.

Students will also need to decide what format their project should take (for example, an online resource, a schoolwide challenge day, or a schoolwide program) and how they will advertise or remind students about it (for example, posters, an ad in the school newspaper, or class presentations). Finally, students will need to create a schedule and assign people to complete each part of the project.
#### Action
Students will put their plan into action. They'll determine the timeline or refer to the schedule part of the plan and begin. They'll also check the schedule frequently to ensure everyone is on task and meeting milestones.
#### Reflection
Students will reflect on what they've learned throughout this process, how what they've done will help all students at school, what challenges they faced, and how they overcame these challenges.
#### Demonstration
Students will implement their project using the plan they created. If possible, give students the opportunity to formally present their project to peers, staff, or families, and describe how they went about creating it.
