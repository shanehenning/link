#### Project Description

### Project Description

There are people in every community who are affected by domestic violence. In this Service-Learning Project, students will explore this issue and create a plan to help support victims of domestic violence.

First, students will identify the effects domestic violence has on people in the community. Then students will investigate ways they can help support people who experience domestic violence (for example, raising awareness about the issue, writing letters of support, or collecting donations for a domestic violence shelter). Finally, students will take steps to support victims of domestic violence in their community.

Project Steps
#### Investigation
First, have students consider the causes of domestic violence and the effects it may have on people in the community. This list can be created in a number of ways, including:


-  Class brainstorm

-  Identifying and interviewing community organizations that support victims of domestic violence

-  Researching the issue of domestic violence

Then have students work with community organizations to identify what they can do to support people who experience domestic violence.
#### Planning
Once students have decided what actions they want to take, they'll create a plan for how to support victims of domestic violence. This plan should include setting goals and timelines, and assigning roles and tasks to specific students.
#### Action
Students will put their plan into action. They'll determine the timeline or refer to the schedule part of the plan and begin. They'll also check the schedule frequently to ensure everyone is on task and meeting milestones.
#### Reflection
Students will reflect on what they've learned throughout this process, how what they've done will help victims of domestic violence, what challenges they faced, and how they overcame these challenges.
#### Demonstration
If the students have chosen to do something that can be observed (such as staging an assembly), have students invite friends, family, and community members to observe them completing the project. Otherwise, have students create a presentation about their project for school staff or community members.
