2. Divide the class into groups of 3 to 4.
3. Allow at least 15 minutes for this activity. If time runs out, continue when time allows.

#### Introduction
Present the activity: **Solving conflicts can be difficult. Roadblocks get in the way and make it hard to find a solution. Take a look at the conflict on the boardâ€”I see this happen often here at school. Today you're going to identify roadblocks that can make it hard to resolve a conflict like this one, and role-play some ways to overcome those roadblocks.**
#### Steps
1. Have the class brainstorm reasons why the conflict you've written on the board can be difficult for students to solve on their own. Write down each idea on a separate note card.
2. Randomly draw one note card for each group.
3. Have each group come up with a way to overcome the roadblock and a skit that demonstrates the solution.
4. Have the groups perform their skits for the class.

#### Reflection
1. Have the class reflect quietly about the following prompt:

**What's one solution you heard today that you might try? Why do you want to try it?**
2. Call on students to tell the class their ideas, as time allows.
