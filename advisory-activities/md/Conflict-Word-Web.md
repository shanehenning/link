#### Prep
1. Before class, choose a conflict you see students at your school get into (for example, pushing in the hall, name-calling, or taking other people's stuff) and write it on the board.

3. Divide the class into groups of 3 to 4.
4. Allow at least 15 minutes for this activity. If time runs out, continue when time allows.

Activity Instructions
#### Introduction
Present the activity: **Take a look at the conflict on the board. This is a conflict I see often here at school. You're going to work in groups to create word webs that identify the possible causes of this conflict.**
#### Steps
1. Hand out materials to each group.
2. Have each group create a word web by brainstorming causes of the conflict, writing them down, and connecting them to the words in the middle of the paper. If time allows, have groups identify causes for the causes and add those to the sheet as well.
3. Post each group's sheet of paper on a wall or the board. Give students a few minutes to quietly review what the other groups wrote.

#### Reflection
1. Have the class reflect quietly about the following prompt:

**Now that you've identified the possible causes for this conflict, what's something you could do to help prevent it, and conflicts like it, from happening in the future?**
2. Call on students to tell the class their ideas, as time allows.
