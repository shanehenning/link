Activity Instructions
#### Introduction
Present the activity: **Today, you'll all engage in a test of strength and wit. The winner is the person who scores the most points, and he or she will receive one piece of candy for each point scored.**
#### Steps
1. Have each pair assume an arm-wrestling position. Partners will sit across from each other at a desk or table, put one elbow on the table, and grasp each other's hand.
2. Explain the scoring rules:
            
You'll get a point every time the back of your partner's hand touches the table.
The person in the class with the most points after 30 seconds wins.
3. Give students 30 seconds to score as many points as they can.
4. Determine which students scored the most points and ask them to explain their strategies. Identify strategies where partners worked cooperatively to win (for example, by letting one person score a lot of points and then splitting the candies afterward). If no one found a cooperative strategy, have students think of ways to find opportunities in conflict and repeat the activity.

#### Reflection
1. Have the class reflect quietly about the following prompt:

**What's a real-life example of a situation where two people in conflict could actually cooperate and both win?**
2. Call on students to tell the class their ideas, as time allows.
