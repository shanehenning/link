Class Meeting Instructions
#### Warm-Up
Have everyone in the class (including you!) briefly answer the following question: 

**People at school sometimes say mean things about each other based on gender. Do you agree or disagree?**
#### Discussion
As a class, discuss one or more of the following prompts, as time allows:


-  **Making comments about people who don't look stereotypically male or female (like a very short boy, or a girl who shaves her head) can be disrespectful. What are some things people have said to you about how you look that you find disrespectful? How did it make you feel?**

-  **Making jokes about people because they don't conform to gender stereotypes (like a boy who dances ballet or a girl who plays first-person shooters) can be disrespectful. Tell us about a time someone made a joke like this about you. How did it make you feel?**

-  **How can disrespectful comments about someone ultimately hurt that person, even if they don't hear the comments?**
#### Reflection
Have the class reflect quietly about the following prompt:

**What's something you can do to decrease the amount of disrespectful comments here at school?**

Call on students to tell the class their ideas, as time allows.
