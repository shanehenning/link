#### Introduction
Present the activity: **Today you're going to work in groups to try a number of methods to score a goal. As you try each method, be thinking about how or why a ball might or might not make it in.**
#### Steps
1. Have the groups move to separate spaces where they can try to score a goal by tossing the ball into the basket or box a few feet in front of them. Give each group a Challenge Card.
2. Have one person in each group do the first challenge listed on the Challenge Card. Once all groups have completed Challenge 1, have the class reflect about the following prompt:

**Who scored a goal? Was that easy to do? Why or why not? **
3. Have the groups continue to follow the Challenge Card, giving each group member a turn. If time permits, have students write their own challenges and try those.
4. Have the students reflect within their groups about the following prompt:

**What made the challenges difficult? How did you overcome the difficulty?**

#### Reflection
1. Have the class reflect quietly about the following prompt:

**What difficult challenges do you face at school? How can you overcome them? **
2. Call on students to tell the class their ideas, as time allows.
