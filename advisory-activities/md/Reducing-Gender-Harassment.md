#### Project Description

### Project Description

Incidents of gender harassment—when boys or girls are bothered, teased, or bullied because they act differently from most boys or girls, or because they may be lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender (LGBTQ)—can happen anywhere, including at school. Raising awareness about this important issue and reducing the number of incidents is a great way to help all students feel safe and supported at school.

In this Service-Learning Project, students will research the different forms gender harassment can take, as well as the effect gender harassment can have on victims. Then students will investigate ways they can help support students who are harassed (for example, creating designated safe spaces at school, starting a campaign to bring awareness to the harm caused by gender harassment, or starting a club to support LGBTQ students). Finally, students will take steps to support and advocate for those who are harassed at school. 

If this project has been done before, students will build on the work started in previous years.

Project Steps
#### Investigation
First, have students research what gender harassment is and how it can affect victims. Then have students identify what gender harassment can look like at school. Finally, have students investigate ways to support students who face gender harassment. This support can be preventive—helping stop gender harassment before it starts—or it can involve helping victims of gender harassment. This work can be accomplished in a number of ways, including:


-  Class brainstorm

-  Interviewing students, teachers, and other staff members

Then have students work with students and school staff to decide what specific actions they'll take to help reduce gender harassment and build a safe and supportive school community.
#### Planning
Once students have decided what actions they want to take to reduce gender harassment at school, they'll create a plan for how to accomplish the project. This plan should include setting goals and timelines, and assigning roles and tasks to specific students.
#### Action
Students will put their plan into action. They'll determine the timeline or refer to the schedule part of the plan and begin. They'll also check the schedule frequently to ensure everyone is on task and meeting milestones.
#### Reflection
Students will reflect on what they've learned throughout this process, how what they've done will help everyone at the school, what challenges they faced, and how they overcame these challenges.
#### Demonstration
If the students have chosen to do something that can be observed (such as staging a play to raise awareness about gender harassment), have them invite friends, family, and community members to observe them completing the project. Otherwise, have students create a presentation about their project for school staff or community members.
