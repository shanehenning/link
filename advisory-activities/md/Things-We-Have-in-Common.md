#### Warm-Up
Have everyone in the class (including you!) briefly answer the following question: 

**What's one thing you have in common with someone else in class? **<br/>
            (Enjoy the same classes. Siblings. Have the same interests.)
#### Discussion
As a class, discuss one or more of the following prompts, as time allows:


-  **Tell us about a time you realized you had something in common with someone you were working with in class.**

-  **How did identifying this similarity help you two work together?**

-  **Why can recognizing the things we have in common help us avoid getting into conflicts with each other?**
#### Reflection
Have the class reflect quietly about the following prompt:

**Think of someone you have trouble getting along with. What's something you two might have in common? How could you use that to help you two get along?**

Call on students to tell the class their ideas, as time allows.
