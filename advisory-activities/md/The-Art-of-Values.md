Activity Instructions
#### Introduction
Present the activity: **Each of you will choose a value that's important to you and create a picture or collage that represents that value. The only rule is that you can't use any words. Don't tell anyone else the value you've chosen, because the class is going to try to guess based on the image you've created.**
#### Steps
1. Hand out art supplies to students.
2. Have students choose a value and create their pictures or collages.
3. Have each student show his or her collage while the rest of the class tries to guess which value it represents.
4. Hang students' art on the wall to create a gallery of values.

#### Reflection
1. Have the class reflect quietly about the following prompt:

**What values did other students choose that you also think are important?**
2. Call on students to tell the class their ideas, as time allows.
