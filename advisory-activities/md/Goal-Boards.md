#### Activity Instructions
Activity Instructions
#### Introduction
Present the activity: **Your goals are an important part of who you are. Each of you will create a picture or collage that represents a goal you have for yourself. You can pick a big goal you want to achieve during your life, or a smaller goal that you want to achieve soon. The only rule is that you can't use any words. Don't tell anyone else the goal you've chosen, because the class is going to try to guess based on what you've created.**
#### Steps
1. Hand out materials to students.
2. Have students quietly think of a goal and create pictures or collages reflecting that goal.
3. Have each student present his or her collage while the rest of the class tries to guess which goal he or she chose.
4. Hang students' art on the wall to create a gallery of goals.

#### Reflection
1. Have the class reflect quietly about the following prompt:

**Creating goals is only the first step. Think of an If!&amp;-&amp;!Then Plan to help you achieve the goal you chose.** If necessary, remind students that in an If!&amp;-&amp;!Then Plan:
            <p class="push-right">**If** is a specific cue you can react to quickly.

**Then** is a specific action or actions you can do immediately.

**If** is a specific cue you can react to quickly.

**Goal:**___________________________________

**If (or when):**______________________________,

**Then:**___________________________________.
3. Call on students to tell the class their ideas, as time allows.
