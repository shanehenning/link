#### Discussion
As a class, discuss one or more of the following prompts, as time allows:


-  **Tell us about one way you've changed. What do you think of the person you've become?**

-  **How have your friends changed since starting middle school? Why do you think this happened?**

-  **Do you think you're done changing? How do you think you'll change in the future?**
