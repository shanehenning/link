#### Preparation
1. Have a list ready of people at school (students or staff) that students can use as resources in their investigation.
2. If multiple classes are collaborating, plan time for them to come together to work.
3. If this project has been done before, have a list ready of previous community improvement projects that students can refer to if they need ideas.

#### Project Description

### Project Description

Feeling connected to the community and having a sense of ownership is beneficial to all types of learners. In this Service-Learning Project, students will investigate ways of improving an area in their community (for example, a park or playground, a library courtyard, or a community athletic field) and develop a plan to do so. Individual classes can each choose their own area to improve, or multiple classes can work together to improve a single place in the community.

Project Steps
#### Investigation
Students will begin by identifying a diverse list of places in the community they think could use physical improvement. This could be a place students use, such as a sports field or library, or a place for others, such as a playground or senior center. Students should identify what kinds of improvements the people who use the space regularly would like to see, and investigate what it would take to make those improvements happen.

Students should also investigate what organizations or entities are in charge of the areas they have identified, then contact them about implementing improvement ideas and to find out ways students can help with the organizations' existing efforts.
#### Planning
After investigating what community areas need improvement, students will create a plan for implementing their project. This could involve organizing a clean-up with volunteers, holding a drive to collect supplies, or working hands-on with other volunteers on a larger project (such as building a new climbing structure at a playground).

Students will also need to create a schedule and assign people to complete each part of the project.
#### Action
Students will put their plan into action. They'll determine the timeline or refer to the schedule part of the plan and begin. They'll also check the schedule frequently to ensure everyone is on task and meeting milestones.
#### Reflection
Students will reflect on what they've learned throughout this process, what their successes and challenges were, and how they've helped their community.
#### Demonstration
Students will create an event or video showcasing their efforts. If possible, give students the opportunity to formally present their improvement project to peers, staff, or families, and describe how they went about creating it.
