#### Introduction
Present the activity: **This activity will require you to work together, communicate with each other, and stay calm. All of these things are important when you're facing a challenge.**
#### Steps
1. Have students stand in two single-file lines. Give a roll of toilet paper to the first person in each line, and explain the rules:
2. As students play, watch closely for infractions of the rules. If you see anything, stop the game and have the class start over.
3. Repeat the game a few times, or until students complete the challenge correctly.
4. Ask students to reflect on what made the game frustrating and what they would change to make it more fun.
5. Have students agree on a new set of rules for the challenge and play again using those rules.

#### Reflection
1. Have the class reflect quietly about the following prompt:

**What's a "rule" in your life that you find frustrating? What can you do to change that rule?**
2. Call on students to tell the class their ideas, as time allows.
