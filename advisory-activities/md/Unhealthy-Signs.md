#### Warm-Up
Have everyone in the class (including you!) briefly answer the following question: 

**Think of a positive relationship you have with a friend or someone you're dating. What one word would you use to describe it?**<br/>
            (Respectful. Supportive. Equals. Fun.)
#### Discussion
As a class, discuss one or more of the following prompts, as time allows:


-  **Think about relationships that aren't so positive. What are some differences between positive and negative relationships?**

-  **What are some things that might happen in a relationship to make it feel negative?**

-  **Can a relationship be negative for both people involved? Why or why not?**

-  **Do you think negative relationships are common here at school? Why or why not?**
#### Reflection
Have the class reflect quietly about the following prompt:

**What kind of effect might a negative relationship have on someone, even after the relationship is over?**

Call on students to tell the class their ideas, as time allows.
