-  **Tell us about a time you tried to learn something difficult. How did it feel to work hard to learn something?**

-  **Tell us about a time you learned something new. How did it feel to get smarter?**

-  **What would you tell a friend who was afraid to try something because he or she thought it would be too difficult?**
