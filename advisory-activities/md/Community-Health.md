#### Project Description

### Project Description

Getting involved in important issues is a great way to help students feel more engaged in their community. In this Service-Learning Project, students will investigate local health issues and create a plan of action to help with one of those issues in a concrete way.

Individual classes can create their own projects, or multiple classes can work together to complete a single project. If this project has been done before, students can refer to previous projects as examples if they need ideas.

Project Steps
#### Investigation
Students will begin by identifying a diverse list of health issues affecting their community. This list will help guide them as they settle on one issue they'd like to address. Next, students will investigate organizations that focus on this issue and choose one they'd like to help. They should identify what kind of help is needed (for example, a drive to collect supplies or a fundraiser), making sure to follow any guidelines or parameters the organization provides.
#### Planning
Students will create a plan to help with a community health issue through their chosen organization. They will need to identify peers, staff, and community members they can ask to help with the project. Finally, students will need to create a schedule and assign people to complete each part of the project.
#### Action
Students will put their plan into action. They'll determine the timeline or refer to the schedule part of the plan and begin. They'll also check the schedule frequently to ensure everyone is on task and meeting milestones.
#### Reflection
Students will reflect on what they've learned throughout this process, what their successes and challenges were, and how they've helped their community.
#### Demonstration
If possible, give students the opportunity to formally present their project to peers, staff, or families (for example, at a community event, school assembly, or in a documentary posted on the school or district website).
