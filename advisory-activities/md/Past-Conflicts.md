Class Meeting Instructions
#### Warm-Up
Have everyone in the class (including you!) briefly answer the following question:

**What's one thing you know now about conflicts that you wish you had known a year ago?**

(I know I can prevent a minor conflict from turning into a serious one. I know that serious conflicts often require help from adults to resolve.)
#### Discussion
As a class, discuss one or more of the following prompts, as time allows:


-  **What's one difficult scenario you dealt with this year? How would you handle it differently if you could?**

-  **If you were involved in a serious conflict this year, what happened?**

-  **Could the conflict have been avoided? How? Could you have helped resolve the conflict? How?**
#### Reflection
Have the class reflect quietly about the following prompt:

**Misunderstandings and jumping to conclusions can lead to serious conflicts. Can you think of a time someone misunderstood you? What happened?**

Call on students to tell the class their ideas, as time allows.
