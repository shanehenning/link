Class Meeting Instructions
#### Warm-Up
Have students raise their hand if they've ever made a mistake. Then have everyone in the class (including you!) briefly answer the following question: 

**Tell us about a time you made a mistake, big or smallâ€”it doesn't matter.**<br/> 
              (Missed a math problem. Said something I shouldn't have. Forgot to do chores. Fell off my skateboard.)
#### Discussion
As a class, discuss one or more of the following prompts, as time allows:


-  **How does it feel to make a mistake?**

-  **Tell us about how you learned something new from making a mistake.**

-  **Agree or disagree: Making mistakes is how you learn. Why do you feel that way?**
#### Reflection
Have the class reflect quietly about the following prompt:

**What's something you've learned recently because of a mistake you made?**

Call on students to tell the class their ideas, as time allows.
