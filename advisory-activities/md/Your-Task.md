Activity Instructions
#### Introduction
Present the activity: **Today you'll get to choose tasks for each other to do. The task you choose can be fun, silly, or even no fun at allâ€”but keep in mind how you think the person who receives the task will feel about it.**
#### Steps
1. Give each student a slip of paper.
2. On the "To" line, have students write the name of any other student in class.
3. On the "From" line, have students write their own name.
4. On the "Task" line, have students write a task they want the person in the "To" line to perform (for example, count to 50 by twos, or spin around in a circle 10 times).
5. After students have finished, collect the slips.
6. Read the first task, but tell the student in the "From" line to perform the task assigned to the person in the "To" line.
7. Go through all the slips, having each person perform the task they intended for the "To" person.

#### Reflection
1. Have the class reflect quietly about the following prompt:

**When you picked a task, how did you think the other person would feel about having to do it? How did you feel when you had to do the task instead?**
2. Call on students to tell the class their ideas, as time allows.
