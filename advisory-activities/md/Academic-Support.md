#### Project Description

### Project Description

Seeking academic support is an important skill for school success, but not knowing where to look for resources can be a barrier to getting help. In this Service-Learning Project, students will explore the different academic support resources available at school to make it easier for new students to get academic support when they need it.

First, students will identify as many academic support resources available at their school as they can. Then they will create a plan for helping new students learn about these opportunities. After they execute their plan, they will reflect on their successes and challenges.

Project Steps
#### Investigation
Students will create a list of academic resources available at school. This list doesn't have to be limited to specific teachers or subject areas, and can include student clubs (such as a book club, technology club, or homework club). This list can be created in a number of ways, including:


-  Class brainstorm

-  Interviewing school staff and other students

Students should also decide what kind of information about the academic resources they need to gather, such as whom to contact, when groups meet, and what academic area each resource supports.
#### Planning
Students will create a plan for:


-  Gathering information about the academic resources they've identified

-  Distributing the information to students (for example, by hosting an academic fair, going into classrooms to share information, and/or creating an online resource for all the information they've gathered)

-  Creating a schedule and assigning people to complete each part of the project
#### Action
Students will put their plan into action. They'll determine the timeline or refer to the schedule part of the plan and begin. They'll also check the schedule frequently to ensure everyone is on task and meeting milestones.
#### Reflection
Students will reflect on what they've learned throughout this process, how what they've done will help other students at school, what challenges they faced, and how they overcame these challenges.
#### Demonstration
Students will make the information they have gathered available for others to use. If possible, give students the opportunity to present the project formally to peers, staff, or families and describe how they went about creating it.
