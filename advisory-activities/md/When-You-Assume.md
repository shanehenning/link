Class Meeting Instructions
#### Warm-Up
Have everyone in the class (including you!) briefly answer the following question:

**Can you name one thing you thought you wouldn't like about middle school, but you're actually enjoying now?**
#### Discussion
As a class, discuss one or more of the following prompts, as time allows:


-  **Why did you assume you wouldn't like that thing? What caused you to change your mind?**

-  **Tell us about a time when you assumed you wouldn't like someone, like another student or a teacher, but ended up actually liking that person.**

-  **Tell us about a time someone made an assumption about you that wasn't correct. How did it make you feel?**
#### Reflection
Have the class reflect quietly about the following prompt:

**Think of someone here at school you don't know, but just assume you wouldn't like. What can you do to check and find out if your assumption might be wrong?**

Call on students to tell the class their ideas, as time allows.
