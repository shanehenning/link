            (Honesty. Hard work. Kindness.)
#### Discussion
As a class, discuss one or more of the following prompts, as time allows:


-  **Why is the value you chose so important to you?**

-  **How does the value you chose help you be a better person?**

-  **Name a person who represents a value we've discussed. How does he or she represent that value?**
#### Reflection
Have the class reflect quietly about the following prompt:

**What's a value someone else chose that you also think is important?**

Call on students to tell the class their ideas, as time allows.
