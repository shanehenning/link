Activity Instructions
#### Introduction
Present the activity: **Today you're going to work in groups to create a piece of art. Taking turns, each group member will have 10 seconds to draw a shape or figure before passing the sheet of paper to the next person. You won't be able to communicate with each other while you workâ€”no talking allowed! Your challenge is to try and figure out what your group is drawing, and to stay flexible and adapt if the drawing goes in an unexpected direction.**
#### Steps
1. Hand out materials to each group.
2. Give one student in each group 10 seconds to draw a shape or figure on the sheet of paper.
3. After 10 seconds, have the first student pass the sheet of paper to the person to his or her right. Have that student add another shape or figure to the drawing.
4. Repeat Step 3 until the drawing is complete (about 3 minutes).
5. After the drawings are complete, have students reflect in their groups about the following prompt:

**What was the drawing originally supposed to be? How did it change over the course of the activity? What is it a drawing of now?**
6. Have the groups present their drawings to the class, making sure to explain what it was originally supposed to be and how it changed.
7. Have each group create a second drawing using the same process. When finished, have the groups compare their first drawing to their second and discuss how the process changed the second time.

#### Reflection
1. Have the class reflect quietly about the following prompt:

**When it was your turn to draw, how did you try to figure out what you were supposed to add? Were you successful? Why or why not?**
2. Call on students to tell the class their ideas, as time allows.
