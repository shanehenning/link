#### Project Description

### Project Description

Unfortunately, incidents of sexual harassment—when someone bothers someone else with words, actions, or pictures of a sexual nature—can happen anywhere, including at school. Helping raise awareness about this important issue and reducing the number of incidents is a great way to help all students feel safe and supported at school.

In this Service-Learning Project, students will research different forms of sexual harassment as well as the effects sexual harassment can have on victims. Then students will investigate ways they can help support students who are sexually harassed (for example, creating a list of mediators or people to go to for help, starting an awareness campaign, or making posters to remind students what to do when sexual harassment happens). Finally, students will take steps to help support and advocate for those in school who are sexually harassed.

If this project has been done before, students will build on the work started in previous years.

Project Steps
#### Investigation
First, have students research what sexual harassment is and how it can affect victims. Then have students identify what sexual harassment can look like at school. Finally, have students investigate ways to support students who experience sexual harassment. This support can be preventive—helping stop sexual harassment before it starts—or it can involve helping victims of sexual harassment. This work can be accomplished in a number of ways, including:


-  Class brainstorm

-  Interviewing students, teachers, and other staff members

-  Researching conflict resolution strategies

Then have students work with students and school staff to decide what specific actions they'll take to help reduce sexual harassment and build a safe and supportive school community.
#### Planning
Once students have decided what actions they want to take to reduce sexual harassment at school, they'll create a plan for how to accomplish the project. This plan should include setting goals and timelines, and assigning roles and tasks to specific students.
#### Action
Students will put their plan into action. They'll determine the timeline or refer to the schedule part of the plan and begin. They'll also check the schedule frequently to ensure everyone is on task and meeting milestones.
#### Reflection
Students will reflect on what they've learned throughout this process, how what they've done will help everyone at school, what challenges they faced, and how they overcame these challenges.
#### Demonstration
If the students have chosen to do something that can be observed (such as leading an awareness march through the hallways at the end of the day), have students invite friends, family, and members of the community to observe them completing the project. Otherwise, have students create a presentation about their project for school staff or community members.
