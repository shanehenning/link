#### Introduction
Present the activity: **Sometimes, finding out the things you have in common with others can prevent conflicts from happening before they even start. Today we'll get to know each other a little better and make our relationships stronger.**
#### Steps
1. Have one group make a circle facing outward. Have the other group make a larger circle around the first circle, facing inward, so the students are face-to-face with one another.
2. Have students start by naming something they have in common with, or enjoy about, the person they're facing.
3. Have the larger circle shift one person to the left and repeat Step 2 with new partners.

#### Reflection
1. Have the class reflect quietly about the following prompt:

**How can finding similarities with others help you avoid serious conflicts?**
2. Call on students to tell the class their ideas, as time allows.
