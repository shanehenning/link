#### Introduction
Present the activity: **Each of you has qualities that make you a good friend. Today you're going to create personal advertisements to let everyone else know about those qualities. When we're done, we'll post the ads for others to see.**
#### Steps
1. Hand out materials to students.
2. Have students create their personal ads. They can use words and/or pictures, and include things they like to do, what they value most, or testimonials from current friends.
3. When students are finished, post the advertisements on a wall in the classroom or school, or online where others can see them.
4. Give the class a few minutes to look at each other's ads.

#### Reflection
1. Have the class reflect quietly about the following prompt:

**Are there students you'd like to get to know better based on their advertisements? What was it that caught your interest?**
2. Call on students to tell the class their ideas, as time allows.
