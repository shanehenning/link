#### Introduction
Present the activity: **For Class Meetings, it's best for us to sit in a circle. We should all be able to see each other, and there shouldn't be anything in the middle. How can this room be rearranged quickly so we can sit in a circle, then put back quickly when we're done?**
#### Steps
1. Have students think quietly for a moment about a plan for rearranging the classroom.
2. Call on students to tell the class their ideas.
3. Have students choose a plan to try.
4. Time the class as they practice rearranging the classroom and putting everything back.
5. If the first plan doesn't work, have students pick another plan and test it.

#### Reflection
1. Have the class reflect quietly about the following prompt:

**How well did the class work together to solve this challenge? What can we do differently the next time we work together?**
2. Call on students to tell the class their ideas, as time allows.
