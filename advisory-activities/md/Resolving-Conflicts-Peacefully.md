Class Meeting Instructions
#### Warm-Up
Have everyone in the class (including you!) briefly answer the following question: 

**What can someone say to make you really upset?**<br/>
            (Personal insult. Insulting a family member. Spreading a rumor.)
#### Discussion
As a class, discuss one or more of the following prompts, as time allows:


-  **When someone makes you really upset, what are some of the different ways you can respond?**

-  **How do you choose the way you respond?**

-  **Think about a time your response ended a conflict peacefully, and another time when it made the conflict worse. Why did you make the choices you did in each situation?**
#### Reflection
Have the class reflect quietly about the following prompt:

**Sometimes it can be hard to resolve a conflict in a positive, peaceful way. What's one reason it's worth trying to resolve a conflict peacefully, even when it might be hard to?**

Call on students to tell the class their ideas, as time allows.
