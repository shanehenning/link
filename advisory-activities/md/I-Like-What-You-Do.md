#### Introduction
Present the activity: **We often spend a lot of time focusing on the problems we're dealing with or things we need to improve. Today we're going to focus on the things that we do well or that make us unique by exchanging compliments. When you're giving a compliment, make sure it's about something the person does or has done well.**
#### Steps
1. Have the class stand in a circle.
2. Pick one student to start. Have that student turn and give a compliment to the person on his or her right. Make sure the compliment is about something the person has done, not about a physical trait.
3. Have the student who received the compliment turn and give a compliment to the person on his or her right.
4. Continue until the last student gives a compliment to the person who started.
5. Have the person who started give a compliment to the person on his or her left.
6. Continue until the last student has given a compliment to the person who started.

#### Reflection
