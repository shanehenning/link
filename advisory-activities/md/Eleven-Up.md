Activity Instructions
#### Introduction
Present the activity: **Today we're going to play a very simple game in groups of 3.**
#### Steps
1. Explain the rules:
            
I'll count to 3. That's the only talking in the game. No talking in your groups.
When I say "three," everyone will hold out one hand and show any number of fingers, from 0 to 5.
The object of the game is for your group of three to end up with exactly 11 fingers out.
Once your group has gotten 11 fingers without talking, you've won. We'll keep going until every group is done.
2. Play until all groups have gotten 11 fingers.
3. To increase the difficulty, have students use both hands, and change the goal so the groups must each have 23 fingers.

#### Reflection
1. Have the class reflect quietly about the following prompt:

**What made this game frustrating to play? How did it feel when your group finally won?**
2. Call on students to tell the class their ideas, as time allows.
