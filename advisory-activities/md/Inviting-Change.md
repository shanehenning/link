#### Warm-Up
Have everyone in the class (including you!) briefly answer the following question:

**What's one thing you've learned about yourself recently?**

(I'm more outgoing than I thought. I stopped liking sports. I discovered I'm a good singer.)
#### Discussion
As a class, discuss one or more of the following prompts, as time allows:


-  **What's one aspect of your identity that you don't want to change when you get to high school? Why is this aspect so important to you?**

-  **Have you learned anything new about your friends in the past year? Give an example.**

-  **Agree or disagree: "Your interests and identity could still change before high school." Explain your thinking.**
#### Reflection
Have the class reflect quietly about the following prompt:

**Is it okay for your identity, personality, and interests to change? Why?**

Call on students to tell the class their ideas, as time allows.
