#### Introduction
Present the activity: **Today we're going to do some group juggling. It can be difficult, but also rewarding if everyone works together. We're going to practice by passing one object, and then we'll add more objects to increase the challenge.**
#### Steps
1. Have the class stand in a circle. Explain the rules:
2. Have the group practice passing the object to everyone once until it comes back around to the first person.
3. Repeat the same pattern one more time so students can practice.
4. Start the same pattern with the same object a third time. Then the person who started the pattern will pass a second object in the same order to see how many objects the class can juggle without dropping any.
5. Have students pass the objects following the same pattern every time.
6. If someone drops an object or the pattern is broken, pause the juggling to discuss improvement strategies and let students try again.

#### Reflection
1. Have the class reflect quietly about the following prompt:

**Group juggling is easier when you work together. What else becomes easier when you work together?**
2. Call on students to tell the class their ideas, as time allows.
