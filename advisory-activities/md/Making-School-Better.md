#### Project Description

### Project Description

School is a complex community with its share of rules, expectations, and customs. These exist for important reasons, but sometimes they don't work as well as they could, causing frustration among students and staff. In this Service-Learning Project, students will identify sources of frustration and ways they can help things work better.

Students will identify things at school that many students find frustrating (such as homework, getting to and from school, making friends, or particular school rules), and investigate ways to make them less frustrating. Then students will pick one area where they feel they can make a difference, and create a plan to do so.

If this project has been done before, students can refer to previous projects for ideas if they need help.

Project Steps
#### Investigation
Have students identify a list of things at school that can be frustrating. They can be related to academics, such as homework or school rules, or they can be nonacademic things, like getting to school, making friends, or using social media. This list can be created in a number of ways, including:


-  Class brainstorm

-  Polling students in other classes

-  Interviewing teachers and other school staff members

Once students have identified potential issues, have them think of possible ways to make each thing less frustrating for everyone. Then have them pick one thing to focus on for their project.
#### Planning
Students will create a plan for how to make the thing they picked work better for everyone. This can take many forms, depending on the topic (for example, a public service announcement campaign to influence students, or a petition students will submit to school administrators). The plan should include setting goals and timelines, and assigning roles and tasks to specific students.
#### Action
Students will put their plan into action. They'll determine the timeline or refer to the schedule part of the plan and begin. They'll also check the schedule frequently to ensure everyone is on task and meeting milestones.
#### Reflection
Students will reflect on what they've learned throughout this process, how what they've done will help others at school, what challenges they faced, and how they overcame these challenges.
#### Demonstration
Have students present the results of their project to peers or school staff and explain the process they used to complete it.
