#### Introduction
Present the activity: **Everyone gets discouraged from time to time. Today you're going to think of helpful thoughts about something you're discouraged about.**
#### Steps
1. Have each student think of a thought they have when they're discouraged. This can be generic, like "I can't do this," or specific, like "I'll never learn polynomials."
2. Have students write a thought at the top of the paper. Make sure they don't write their names.
3. Collect the papers, shuffle them, and pass them back out to the class.
4. Have each student respond to the unhelpful thought at the top of the paper with a helpful one, like "I can't do thisâ€”yet," or "I'll ask for help to learn polynomials."
5. Have students cross out the unhelpful thought and write the helpful one below it. Then have students pass their sheets of paper to the person next to them.
6. Have students add another helpful thought to the sheet.
7. Repeat Steps 5 and 6, as time allows.
8. Collect the sheets and hang them on a wall in the classroom or hall.

#### Reflection
1. Have the class reflect quietly about the following prompt:

**How did this activity change the way you think about the thoughts you have when you're discouraged?**
2. Call on students to tell the class their ideas, as time allows.
