#### Introduction
Present the activity: **Sometimes what seems like a bad thing can actually be a good thing. It's all about your perspective. Today we'll try to use positive terms to define a word that is usually seen as negative.**
#### Steps
1. Hand out materials to each group.
2. Have each group pick a word that represents something people often view as negative (for example, "anger," "mistakes," "emotional," or "conflict"). Have each group write the word down at the top of the paper.
3. Have each group decide on a typical, negative definition for the word and write it on the sheet of paper.
4. Have each group cross out the first definition and write a new, positive definition.
5. If time allows, have the groups create illustrations to accompany their new definitions.
6. Have the groups share their definitions and illustrations with the class.

#### Reflection
1. Have the class reflect quietly about the following prompt:

**How do the words used in a definition affect the way we think about the word?**
2. Call on students to tell the class their ideas, as time allows.
