#### Introduction
Present the activity: **Today we're going to play a very simple game in groups of 3.**
#### Steps
- Explain the rules:
            
Ill count to 3. Thats the only talking in the game. No talking in your groups.
When I say three, everyone will hold out one hand and show any number of fingers, from 0 to 5.
The object of the game is for your group of three to end up with exactly 11 fingers out.
Once your group has gotten 11 fingers without talking, youve won. Well keep going until every group is done.
- Play until all groups have gotten 11 fingers.
- To increase the difficulty, have students use both hands, and change the goal so the groups must each have 23 fingers.

#### Reflection
- Have the class reflect quietly about the following prompt:

**What made this game frustrating to play? How did it feel when your group finally won?**
- Call on students to tell the class their ideas, as time allows.

The community were all a part of here at school also has values. Knowing which values are most important to our community will help make school a positive place for everyone.**
#### Steps
- Have students quietly think of three values that are most important to them at school.
- Poll students on the values they chose. Write them on the whiteboard, noting how many times each value was chosen. Alternatively, use polling or word-cloud apps to generate digital lists of values.
- Identify the 6 to 10 most commonly chosen values. For each one, call on a student to explain why its important.
- Have students vote on which values they think are most important. Each student can vote three times. The top three values are the shared class values.
- (Optional) Representatives from the class can take the three shared class values to a meeting of representatives from other classes. Repeat Steps 3 and 4 with the larger group to identify shared grade or school values.

#### Reflection
- Have the class reflect quietly about the following prompt:

**Were you surprised by the shared values this class agreed on? Why or why not?**
- Call on students to tell the class their ideas, as time allows.

#### Activity Instructions
Activity Instructions
#### Introduction
Present the activity: **Today were going to learn and practice a technique to help us change how we react to failing and making mistakes. Its called the Failure Bow. **
#### Steps
- Explain the rules:
            
Usually when we make a mistake, we feel bad, and our bodies reactwe cringe, flinch, hesitate, or hide our faces. The Failure Bow is a technique to take that bad feeling and transform it so you can feel good about the mistake.
To do the bow, youll fling your arms into the air (like a gymnast or trapeze artist does after landing), grin, and yell, Woohoo! I failed!
First were going to practice the Failure Bow on our own and then well cheer for each other as we celebrate our mistakes.
- Have students practice the Failure Bow 3 times:
            
Everyone stand up. Think of a mistake you made that you felt really bad about at the time. 
As your body begins to react negatively, throw your arms into the air, grin, and yell, Woohoo! I failed!
- Have the 2 groups of students stand facing each other. Designate one group of students as the Performers and the other group as the Audience.
- Have the Performers think of a mistake or failure that made them feel really bad, and on the count of 3, do the Failure Bow as a group.
- Have the Audience clap loudly and cheer the Performers on as they celebrate their mistakes.
- Have the groups of students switch roles and repeat Steps 4 and 5.

#### Introduction
Present the activity: **Well be spending some time getting to know each other today. Ill divide you into two groups and give each of you a note card. When you get the card, youll write five little
- known facts about yourself on one side. Ill read each card out loud, and each group will try to guess who in the other group the facts describe.**
#### Steps
- Have the two groups face each other.
- Give each student a blank note card and have students write five little-known facts about themselves on their cards. (For example, I was born in Zurich. My favorite food is cabbage. My grandmothers name is Opal).
- Collect the cards, keeping the cards from each group in separate piles.
- Draw a card from one groups pile and read the first fact on it.
- Have the opposite group try to guess which person the card describes. If they dont guess correctly on the first try, read the next fact and have them guess again. Continue down the card until they guess correctly or you run out of facts.
- Groups get 5 points if they guess correctly on the first fact, 4 for the second fact, 3 for the third, and so on. Keep score on a piece of scratch paper, or have students keep score.
- Play as many rounds as time allows, making sure youve read the same number of cards from both groups.
- Add up the scores. The group with the most points wins.

#### Reflection
- Have the class reflect quietly about the following prompt:

**What were some things you learned about others today that really surprised you?**

Have a list ready of care facilities in the local community that students can contact about their needs.

If this project has been done before, have students refer to the previous project for ideas if they need help.

### Project Description

Supporting sick or injured people is an important part of building community. In this Service
- Learning Project, students will identify organizations in the community that help sick or injured people, then investigate ways they can support these organizations and the people they serve (for example, with a sympathy cardwriting campaign or a donation drive). Finally, students will create and execute a plan based on their research.

If this project has been done before, students can use previous ideas as examples if they need help.
#### Planning
Have students identify organizations in the community that support sick or injured people, either on their own or from a list you provide. Then have students contact the organizations to find out what they can do to support them.
#### Action
Once the students have identified an organization and what theyll do to help, theyll create a plan for providing the support the organization needs. This plan should include setting goals and timelines, and assigning roles and tasks to specific students.
#### Reflection
Students will put their plan into action. Theyll determine the timeline or refer to the schedule part of the plan and begin. Theyll also check the schedule frequently to ensure everyone is on task and meeting milestones.
#### Demonstration
Students will reflect on what theyve learned throughout this process, how what they did helped or encouraged sick or injured people in the community, what challenges they faced, and how they overcame these challenges.

#### Preparation
- Have a list ready of support staff members at your school who are willing and able to work with students.
- If this project has been done before, have a list ready of examples of ways to help the support staff that students can refer to if they need ideas.

#### Project Description

### Project Description

Support staffsuch as custodians, office managers, bus drivers, and IT staffare key members of the school community, but the importance of their work is not always obvious to students. Investigating what these people do and exploring ways to acknowledge and assist them is a great way to build a positive school community.

In this Service-Learning Project, students will identify the things support staff do every day to keep the school running, and the skills they use to do their jobs well. Then students will investigate ways they can acknowledge and assist support staff members (for example, volunteering to help, starting an awareness campaign for a particular issue, or making posters that show their gratitude and appreciation). Finally, students will take the necessary steps to assist these staff members in the ways they have identified.

If this project has been done before, students can use previous ideas as examples if they need help.

#### Planning
Students will begin by identifying a diverse list of places in the community they think could use physical improvement. This could be a place students use, such as a sports field or library, or a place for others, such as a playground or senior center. Students should identify what kinds of improvements the people who use the space regularly would like to see, and investigate what it would take to make those improvements happen.

Students should also investigate what organizations or entities are in charge of the areas they have identified, then contact them about implementing improvement ideas and to find out ways students can help with the organizations existing efforts.
#### Action
After investigating what community areas need improvement, students will create a plan for implementing their project. This could involve organizing a clean
- up with volunteers, holding a drive to collect supplies, or working hands
- on with other volunteers on a larger project (such as building a new climbing structure at a playground).

Students will also need to create a schedule and assign people to complete each part of the project.

#### Planning
The class will create a list of physical areas of the campus that could use improvement. This list can be created in a number of ways, including:


-  Class brainstorm

-  Interviewing older students and/or staff

-  Polling students in different classes

If the students identify an overwhelming number of campus areas in need of improvement, they may have to prioritize them and choose the most important one to focus on.
#### Action
After choosing a campus area to focus on, students will create a plan for identifying whom to go to for help in improving that area. If there are any special requirements for their chosen improvement project (for example, from the district), students will need to incorporate that into their plan. Next, students will decide what pieces of the project must be addressed in what order, how they will execute the improvement project (for example, a community work party), and whether they will need to raise any funds for materials. Finally, students will need to create a schedule and assign people to complete each part of the project.
#### Reflection
Students will put their plan into action. Theyll determine the timeline or refer to the schedule part of the plan and begin. Theyll also check the schedule frequently to ensure everyone is on task and meeting milestones.

#### Project Description

### Project Description

Learning whom to go to for help at school is an important part of making the transition to middle school. However, students will need help with different problems in different classes, and the best person to help with one problem may not be the best person to help with another.

In this Service-Learning Project, students will identify the problems they think theyre most likely to need help with (for example, opening lockers, finding classes, getting homework done, making friends, or staying out of trouble). Then students will investigate who the best people at school are to ask for help with each problem, such as a particular teacher, counselor, administrator, or another student. Finally, students will create a directory listing all the people at school who are available to help and what kind of help they can give. Individual classes can create their own directories, or multiple classes can work together to create a single directory for all students to use.

If this project has been done before, students can revise and update the old directory to reflect new concerns, as well as any changes in the staff and student body.

School is a complex community with its share of rules, expectations, and customs. These exist for important reasons, but sometimes they dont work as well as they could, causing frustration among students and staff. In this Service-Learning Project, students will identify sources of frustration and ways they can help things work better.

Students will identify things at school that many students find frustrating (such as homework, getting to and from school, making friends, or particular school rules), and investigate ways to make them less frustrating. Then students will pick one area where they feel they can make a difference, and create a plan to do so.

If this project has been done before, students can refer to previous projects for ideas if they need help.

### Project Description

School is a complex community with its share of rules, expectations, and customs. These exist for important reasons, but sometimes they dont work as well as they could, causing frustration among students and staff. In this Service
- Learning Project, students will identify sources of frustration and ways they can help things work better.

Students will identify things at school that many students find frustrating (such as homework, getting to and from school, making friends, or particular school rules), and investigate ways to make them less frustrating. Then students will pick one area where they feel they can make a difference, and create a plan to do so.

If this project has been done before, students can refer to previous projects for ideas if they need help.
#### Planning
Have students identify a list of things at school that can be frustrating. They can be related to academics, such as homework or school rules, or they can be nonacademic things, like getting to school, making friends, or using social media. This list can be created in a number of ways, including:


-  Class brainstorm

-  Polling students in other classes

-  Interviewing teachers and other school staff members

Once students have identified potential issues, have them think of possible ways to make each thing less frustrating for everyone. Then have them pick one thing to focus on for their project.
#### Action
Students will create a plan for how to make the thing they picked work better for everyone. This can take many forms, depending on the topic (for example, a public service announcement campaign to influence students, or a petition students will submit to school administrators). The plan should include setting goals and timelines, and assigning roles and tasks to specific students.
#### Reflection
Students will put their plan into action. Theyll determine the timeline or refer to the schedule part of the plan and begin. Theyll also check the schedule frequently to ensure everyone is on task and meeting milestones.
#### Demonstration
Students will reflect on what theyve learned throughout this process, how what theyve done will help others at school, what challenges they faced, and how they overcame these challenges.

#### Project Description

### Project Description

When people feel positive about themselves and their community, the whole community benefits. One way to help build a positive community is to provide children at early learning centers access to enjoyable books.

In this Service-Learning Project, students will identify books for young children that help inspire positive feelings about themselves and their community. Then students will identify early learning centers in their community and find out how they can help children experience these books (for example, a book drive, creating e-books or audiobooks, or volunteering to read books aloud). Finally, students will create and execute a plan based on their research.

If this project has been done before, students can refer to past ideas as examples if they need help.

#### Planning
Students will identify books for young children that inspire positive feelings about themselves and their community. This list of books can be created in a number of ways, including:


-  Compiling a list based on their own past experiences

-  Asking adults who may have knowledge about early learning books

-  Asking students in different classes for their opinions

-  Researching online

-  Asking a school or community librarian

Students will also investigate what resources early learning centers may be lacking by contacting early learning centers in the community. If students identify an overwhelming number of needs among local organizations, they may have to choose the most important ones for the purposes of this project.
#### Action
Based on their investigation, students will create a plan for how theyll help children at an early learning center experience the books theyve identified (for example, raising money or gathering books to donate, or helping children experience these books directly, either digitally or by volunteering at the center). This plan should include setting goals and timelines, as well as assigning roles and tasks to specific students.
#### Reflection
Students will put their plan into action. Theyll determine the timeline or refer to the schedule part of the plan and begin. Theyll also check the schedule frequently to ensure everyone is on task and meeting milestones.

Volunteering to help people outside of school is an important part of building community and taking ownership. But in order to be helpful, students need to know which community organizations are looking for volunteers.

In this Service-Learning Project, students will identify service organizations in their community. Then they will investigate which of those organizations are seeking volunteers, the process for becoming a volunteer, and the guidelines for being a volunteer (for example, age or time commitment). Then students will create a volunteer guide listing all the organizations theyve found that are seeking volunteers and the process for becoming one. Individual classes can create their own volunteer guides, or multiple classes can work together to create a single guide all students can use.

Students will create a plan for identifying what people, strategies, and services are available to help them in practicing personal wellness. They may draw from their own experiences, interview other students and staff, or research what services or staff members are available to help at school or in the district.

Students will also need to decide what format their project should take (for example, an online resource, a schoolwide challenge day, or a schoolwide program) and how they will advertise or remind students about it (for example, posters, an ad in the school newspaper, or class presentations). Finally, students will need to create a schedule and assign people to complete each part of the project.

Have a short list ready of some pressing health issues, either in the community or in the world, to help get students thinking.

If multiple classes are collaborating, plan time for them to come together to work.

If this project has been done before, have copies of previous projects for students to refer to.

### Project Description

Getting involved in important issues is a great way to help students feel more engaged in their community. In this Service
- Learning Project, students will investigate local health issues and create a plan of action to help with one of those issues in a concrete way.

Individual classes can create their own projects, or multiple classes can work together to complete a single project. If this project has been done before, students can refer to previous projects as examples if they need ideas.
#### Planning
Students will begin by identifying a diverse list of health issues affecting their community. This list will help guide them as they settle on one issue theyd like to address. Next, students will investigate organizations that focus on this issue and choose one theyd like to help. They should identify what kind of help is needed (for example, a drive to collect supplies or a fundraiser), making sure to follow any guidelines or parameters the organization provides.
#### Action
Students will create a plan to help with a community health issue through their chosen organization. They will need to identify peers, staff, and community members they can ask to help with the project. Finally, students will need to create a schedule and assign people to complete each part of the project.
#### Reflection
Students will put their plan into action. Theyll determine the timeline or refer to the schedule part of the plan and begin. Theyll also check the schedule frequently to ensure everyone is on task and meeting milestones.
#### Demonstration
Students will reflect on what theyve learned throughout this process, what their successes and challenges were, and how theyve helped their community.

- If multiple classes are collaborating, plan time for them to come together to work.

#### Project Description

### Project Description

Seeking academic support is an important skill for school success, but not knowing where to look for resources can be a barrier to getting help. In this Service-Learning Project, students will explore the different academic support resources available at school to make it easier for new students to get academic support when they need it.

First, students will identify as many academic support resources available at their school as they can. Then they will create a plan for helping new students learn about these opportunities. After they execute their plan, they will reflect on their successes and challenges.

#### Instructions Header
Project Steps
#### Investigation
Students will create a list of academic resources available at school. This list doesnt have to be limited to specific teachers or subject areas, and can include student clubs (such as a book club, technology club, or homework club). This list can be created in a number of ways, including:


-  Class brainstorm

-  Interviewing school staff and other students

Students should also decide what kind of information about the academic resources they need to gather, such as whom to contact, when groups meet, and what academic area each resource supports.
#### Planning
Students will create a plan for:


-  Gathering information about the academic resources theyve identified

-  Distributing the information to students (for example, by hosting an academic fair, going into classrooms to share information, and/or creating an online resource for all the information theyve gathered)

-  Creating a schedule and assigning people to complete each part of the project
#### Action
Students will put their plan into action. Theyll determine the timeline or refer to the schedule part of the plan and begin. Theyll also check the schedule frequently to ensure everyone is on task and meeting milestones.
#### Reflection
Students will reflect on what theyve learned throughout this process, how what theyve done will help other students at school, what challenges they faced, and how they overcame these challenges.
#### Demonstration
Students will make the information they have gathered available for others to use. If possible, give students the opportunity to present the project formally to peers, staff, or families and describe how they went about creating it.

Have a list ready of community organizations that support victims of domestic violence.

### Project Description

There are people in every community who are affected by domestic violence. In this Service
- Learning Project, students will explore this issue and create a plan to help support victims of domestic violence.

First, students will identify the effects domestic violence has on people in the community. Then students will investigate ways they can help support people who experience domestic violence (for example, raising awareness about the issue, writing letters of support, or collecting donations for a domestic violence shelter). Finally, students will take steps to support victims of domestic violence in their community.
#### Planning
First, have students consider the causes of domestic violence and the effects it may have on people in the community. This list can be created in a number of ways, including:


-  Class brainstorm

-  Identifying and interviewing community organizations that support victims of domestic violence

-  Researching the issue of domestic violence

Then have students work with community organizations to identify what they can do to support people who experience domestic violence.
#### Action
Once students have decided what actions they want to take, theyll create a plan for how to support victims of domestic violence. This plan should include setting goals and timelines, and assigning roles and tasks to specific students.
#### Reflection
Students will put their plan into action. Theyll determine the timeline or refer to the schedule part of the plan and begin. Theyll also check the schedule frequently to ensure everyone is on task and meeting milestones.
#### Demonstration
Students will reflect on what theyve learned throughout this process, how what theyve done will help victims of domestic violence, what challenges they faced, and how they overcame these challenges.

#### Preparation
- Have an employee directory or contact list ready to help students expand their investigation.
- If multiple classes are collaborating, plan time for them to come together to work.
- If this project has been done before, have a copy of the old service guide ready for students to refer to. Make note of any staff members who are no longer at the school.

#### Project Description

### Project Description

Being helpful to others at school is an important part of building community and taking ownership. One way to be helpful at school is to assist school staff members (for example, teachers; office, administrative, or custodial staff; or outside service providers working at the school) with specific tasks.

In this Service-Learning Project, students will identify tasks they think staff members will most likely need help with throughout the school year (for example, cleaning classrooms, filing papers, technical assistance, and setting up lessons). Then theyll investigate what tasks staff members actually need help with and create a service guide listing these tasks that other students can use to find opportunities to help out. Individual classes can create their own service guides, or multiple classes can work together to create a single service guide for the whole school to use.

If this project has been done before, students can revise and update the old service guide to reflect new tasks and changes to the needs of teachers or staff members.

-  Class brainstorm

-  Interviewing or polling teachers, other staff members (counselors, principals, secretaries), or other students

-  Drawing from their own experiences

If students identify an overwhelming number of needs, they may have to prioritize them and choose the most important ones to include in their guide.
#### Action
Students will create a plan for:


-  Identifying the tasks teachers or staff members may need help with

-  Deciding what format they want to use for their guide

-  How they'll produce the guide (for example, pen and paper, printed document, or website)

-  Whether they'll include visuals along with the text

-  Creating a schedule and assigning people to complete each part of the project
