#### Introduction
Present the activity: **We all have more in common than we think. In this activity, we'll see that we each have something positive going on in our lives right now, and that those things connect us.**
#### Steps
1. Have students stand with you in a circle.
2. Hold the ball of string in one hand and the end of the string in the other.
3. Say your name and one thing in your life that you feel good about right now. Then toss or roll the ball to a student while holding on to the end of the string.
4. Have the student who caught the ball say the name of the previous person (in this case, you) and one thing he or she feels good about right now. Then have the student hold on to the string and toss the ball to the next person.
5. Repeat Step 4 until all students have participated. Eventually there will be a web of string between everyone in the circle, showing how everyone is connected.

#### Reflection
1. Have the class reflect quietly about the following prompt:

**How will reflecting on the positives in your life and making connections with others in class help you as the year goes on?**
2. Call on students to tell the class their ideas, as time allows.
