Activity Instructions
#### Introduction
Present the activity: **Today you're going to work in groups to practice your perspective-taking skills by trying to recreate an illustration. First, your group will get a fragment of an illustration. Then you'll need to guess what the illustrator was trying to draw and recreate the rest of the illustration yourselves. When you're done, we'll compare what the different groups came up with.**
#### Steps
1. Hand out a piece of the illustration and materials to each group.
2. Have the groups recreate the original illustration based on the small pieces they were given.
3. Have the groups show the class what they came up with and explain their reasoning.
4. Show the class the entire original illustration and compare it to what each group created.

#### Reflection
1. Have the class reflect quietly about the following prompt:

**What was similar and different about the illustrations the different groups created? Why do you think those similarities and differences exist?**
2. Call on students to tell the class their ideas, as time allows.
