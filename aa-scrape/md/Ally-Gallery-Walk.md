Activity Instructions
#### Introduction
Present the activity: **Bullying and harassment can seem like very difficult issues to deal with, but each of you can make a real impact by being an ally to someone who is bullied or harassed. Being an ally means supporting someone else. What an ally does can be big or smallâ€”it doesn't matter, as long as the ally is doing something to support the person. Today you'll work together to think of as many different ways to be an ally as possible.**
#### Steps
1. Seat each group around a desk or table. Give each group 1 pack of sticky notes.
2. Have each group take 5 minutes to brainstorm as many ideas as possible for how to be an ally, and write each idea on its own sticky note. When the 5 minutes is up, have the groups attach their sticky notes to the desk or table where they've been sitting.
3. Give the class 5 minutes to quietly walk around the room and read what other groups wrote.
4. Have students return to their original groups and identify the similarities they saw among the ideas they came up with and the ideas other groups wrote.

#### Reflection
1. Have the class reflect quietly about the following prompt:

**If everyone here chooses to be an ally, you all can do a lot to make this school a place where everyone feels welcome. What's one thing you might try to do if you see someone being bullied or harassed?**
2. Call on students to tell the class their ideas, as time allows.
