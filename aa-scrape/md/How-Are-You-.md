#### Introduction
Present the activity: **Today you're going to list your values and emotions on a sheet of paper and turn it into a paper airplane. Then other people will try to describe you based on what you wrote.**
#### Steps
1. Have students write the following on a sheet of paper without using their names:
2. Have students make paper airplanes out of their sheets of paper. Show students who are having difficulty how to make one, or have students show each other.
3. When everyone is ready, have students throw their airplanes around the room. When planes land nearby, have students pick them up and throw them again, regardless of whose planes they are, until all the planes are completely mixed up.
4. After 1 to 2 minutes, have everyone pick up someone else's airplane.
5. Have students describe the person whose airplane they picked up based on the values and emotions listed.

#### Reflection
1. Have the class reflect quietly about the following prompt:

**How does hearing about how others feel affect your own feelings?**
2. Call on students to tell the class their ideas, as time allows.
