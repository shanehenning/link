#### Warm-Up
Have everyone in the class (including you!) briefly answer the following question: 

**Almost everyone experiences rejection from other people at some point. Maybe one person doesn't make a sports team, and another loses a friend. What are some things students do here at school in which they risk being rejected?**<br/>
            (Sports team. Class office election. Auditioning for a play.)
#### Discussion
As a class, discuss one or more of the following prompts, as time allows:


-  **What can it feel like to be rejected?**

-  **What are some ways you've seen people respond to rejection?**

-  **How can being rejected be a positive thing sometimes, in the long run?**
#### Reflection
Have the class reflect quietly about the following prompt:

**What is one positive way you can deal with rejection?**

Call on students to tell the class their ideas, as time allows.
