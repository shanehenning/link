Activity Instructions
#### Introduction
Present the activity: **Challenging yourself to learn new things helps your brain grow. You're all going to learn something new from each other right now.**
#### Steps
1. Hand out a note card to each student.
2. Have students write their names and one skill or talent they can teach the rest of the class in 5 minutes or less. This can be simple, like a phrase in another language, how to make a paper airplane, or a card trick.
3. Collect the note cards.
4. Pick a card (you can choose or pick one randomly) and have the student who wrote it come to the front of the class and teach his or her skill or talent.
5. Give students a chance to practice what they've learned.
6. If students are having trouble learning the skill, encourage them to ask questions.
7. After 5 to 10 minutes, draw a new card. Repeat Steps 4 to 6, as time allows.

#### Reflection
1. Have the class reflect quietly about the following prompt:

**What did it feel like to try to learn something new? How did it help you grow your brain?**
2. Call on students to tell the class their ideas, as time allows.
