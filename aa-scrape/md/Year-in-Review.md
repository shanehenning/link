#### Warm-Up
Have everyone in the class (including you!) briefly answer the following question:

**What's your favorite memory from the past year and why?**
#### Discussion
As a class, discuss one or more of the following prompts, as time allows:


-  **Did you encounter any conflicts this year? How did you handle them? How would you handle them differently if you could?**

-  **What was one difficult decision you had to make this year? How did your values affect this decision?**

-  **Imagine you can talk to yourself at the beginning of the year. Knowing all that you know now, what advice would you give your younger self?**
#### Reflection
Have the class reflect quietly about the following prompt:

**What's one goal you set this year? Did you meet it? If so, what steps did you take? If not, how will you try to meet it in the future?**

Call on students to tell the class their ideas, as time allows.
