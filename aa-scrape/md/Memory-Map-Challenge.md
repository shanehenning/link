#### Prep
1. Choose a map to have students recreate. It should be a place they're familiar with, such as the state, province, or city they live in. Hide this map in your room so students can't see it until the end of the activity.
2. Have one set of materials ready for each group.
3. Divide the class into groups of 3 to 4.
4. Allow at least 15 minutes for this activity.

#### Introduction
Present the activity: **Today you're going to work in groups to complete a difficult challenge. The groups will compete to recreate a map completely from memory, and the group that creates the most accurate map will be the winner. Your goal is not just to win, but also to avoid conflicts within your groups.**
#### Steps
1. Hand out materials to each group.
2. Have groups recreate the map from memory, beginning with a simple outline.
3. If students find the task too easy, increase the difficulty by asking students to include more and more specific details (for example, names of major cities, roads, or transit stations).
4. Continue increasing the difficulty, as time allows.
5. Reveal the map and determine which group created the most accurate recreation.

#### Reflection
1. Have the class reflect quietly about the following prompt:

**What potential conflicts did your group face in this challenge? Do you think your group handled those conflicts well? Why or why not?**
2. Call on students to tell the class their ideas, as time allows.
