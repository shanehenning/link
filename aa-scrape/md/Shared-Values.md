Activity Instructions
#### Introduction
Present the activity: **Values are things that matter to you most, like respect, honesty, or working hard. Each of you has your own values, which help you make good decisions. The community we're all a part of here at school also has values. Knowing which values are most important to our community will help make school a positive place for everyone.**
#### Steps
1. Have students quietly think of three values that are most important to them at school.
2. Poll students on the values they chose. Write them on the whiteboard, noting how many times each value was chosen. Alternatively, use polling or word-cloud apps to generate digital lists of values.
3. Identify the 6 to 10 most commonly chosen values. For each one, call on a student to explain why it's important.
4. Have students vote on which values they think are most important. Each student can vote three times. The top three values are the shared class values.
5. (Optional) Representatives from the class can take the three shared class values to a meeting of representatives from other classes. Repeat Steps 3 and 4 with the larger group to identify shared grade or school values.

#### Reflection
1. Have the class reflect quietly about the following prompt:

**Were you surprised by the shared values this class agreed on? Why or why not?**
2. Call on students to tell the class their ideas, as time allows.
