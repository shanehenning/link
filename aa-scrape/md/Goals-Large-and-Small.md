-  **Not all goals have to be big. Tell us about a small, simple goal you have.**

-  **Which do you think are more useful, big goals or small goals? Why?**

-  **How are big goals and small goals related? How can small goals help you achieve big goals?**

**Thing of a big goal you have. What are some small goals you can set for yourself that will help you achieve your big goal?**
