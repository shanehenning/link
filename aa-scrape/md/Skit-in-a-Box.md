#### Introduction
Present the activity: **Today you're going to work in groups to create and perform skits for the class. Each group will get a box of props. Your group must use all the props in your skit.**
#### Steps
1. Give each group 1 box of props.
2. Give each group 5 minutes to create a skit using all the props in the box.
3. Have the groups perform their skits for the class.

#### Reflection
1. Have the class reflect quietly about the following prompt:

**Each group had the exact same props, but each used them in different ways. Why do you think the different groups chose to use the props the way they did? If you were working by yourself, how might you have used the props differently?**
2. Call on students to tell the class their ideas, as time allows.
