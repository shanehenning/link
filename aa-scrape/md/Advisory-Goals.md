Class Meeting Instructions
#### Warm-Up
Start by telling the class the official purpose of your advisory program (for example, academic support, building relationships, or service learning) and what you personally hope to get out of teaching advisory (for example, getting to know students or helping them succeed academically).

Have everyone in the class briefly answer the following question:

**What's one thing you hope to get out of advisory this year?**<br/>
            (Have fun. Meet new students. Time to do homework. A place to relax. A chance to work on nonacademic projects.)
#### Discussion
As a class, discuss one or more of the following prompts, as time allows:


-  **How can I and the rest of the staff at school help you get what you want from advisory?**

-  **How can the other students in this advisory help you?**

-  **How can you help me get what I want out of advisory?**
#### Reflection
Have the class reflect quietly about the following prompt:

**What's one thing you can do during advisory to help everyone get what they want?**

Call on students to tell the class their ideas, as time allows.
