#### Introduction
Present the activity: **Each group will have 10 minutes to work together to build the tallest tower they can, using only spaghetti, a marshmallow, string, and tape. The group with the tallest tower wins!**
#### Steps
1. Hand out materials to each group.
2. Give the groups 10 minutes to build their towers.
3. If the groups finish quickly, increase the challenge by providing each group with a second marshmallow.
4. Measure the towers and identify the winning group.

#### Reflection
1. Have the class reflect quietly about the following prompt:

**How many different designs did your group consider before you started building? Would your group have done better if you'd considered fewer or more designs?**
2. Call on students to tell the class their ideas, as time allows.
