#### Project Description

### Project Description

Showing recognition is an important part of building community and making people feel appreciated. One way to show recognition is to create awards for organizations or people in the community and present them with certificates.

In this Service-Learning Project, students will identify areas in which they think organizations or people in the community deserve recognition (for example, best customer service award, hardest-working police officer award, or most helpful volunteer organization award). Then students will investigate what awards teachers and school staff think should be presented to community members or organizations. Finally, students will choose recipients for the awards, create certificates, and present them to the people or organizations they selected based on merit.

If this project has been done before, students can use previous awards as examples if they need ideas.

Project Steps
#### Investigation
Students will identify award categories in which to recognize community members or organizations. This can be accomplished in a number of ways, including:


-  Class brainstorm

-  Asking teachers and other staff members

-  Asking students in different classes

-  Asking parents or other adults in the community

-  Researching online

If students identify an overwhelming number of award categories, they may have to prioritize them and choose the most important ones to create award certificates for.
#### Planning
Students will create a plan for identifying the award categories they'll use. They'll also have to decide what awards they'll ultimately give out, who the organization or community member recipients will be, and how they'll produce the certificates (for example, pen and paper or printed document). Finally, students will need to assign people to complete each part of the project.
#### Action
Students will put their plan into action. They'll determine the timeline or refer to the schedule part of the plan and begin. They'll also check the schedule frequently to ensure everyone is on task and meeting milestones.
#### Reflection
Students will reflect on what they've learned throughout this process, how what they've done will help organizations or community members feel recognized, what challenges they faced, and how they overcame these challenges.
#### Demonstration
Students will write or type and print their award certificates and present them to the organizations or community members they've chosen. If possible, give students the opportunity to present the awards formally, and allow them to explain why they awarded the certificates to the organizations or community members they did.
