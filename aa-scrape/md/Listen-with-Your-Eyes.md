#### Introduction
Present the activity: **When we talk, we use more than just words to speak; we use our whole bodies. And when we listen, we use more than just our ears; we watch with our eyes for physical cues that tell us what others are trying to say. Today you'll practice listening with your eyes by trying to figure out what's happening in a video clip based only on what you can see.**
#### Steps
1. Play the video clip with the sound muted.
2. Have each group decide what they think is happening in the video. If time allows, have each group write a script to accompany the video.
3. Have the groups tell the class what they came up with. Discuss the similarities and differences between the responses.
4. Play the video clip again, this time with sound. Identify what the class got right and wrong.

#### Reflection
1. Have the class reflect quietly about the following prompt:

**How do you use your body to communicate?**
2. Call on students to tell the class their ideas, as time allows.
