#### Introduction
Present the activity: **Today your challenge is to design rides for a new amusement park. The park is called Emotion World, and each ride should be designed to make the people who ride it experience a specific emotion.**
#### Steps
1. Assign each group a different emotion (for example, surprise, joy, boredom, fear, excitement, wonder, confusion, or happiness).
2. Have each group design an amusement park ride that will make riders feel the assigned emotion. Each group should write a description of the ride and draw a picture of it.
3. Have the groups show and describe their Emotion World attractions to the class.

#### Reflection
1. Have the class reflect quietly about the following prompt:

**What are some things people do in the real world to deliberately cause others to feel a particular emotion?**
2. Call on students to tell the class their ideas, as time allows.
