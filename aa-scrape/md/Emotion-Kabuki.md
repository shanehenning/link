#### Prep
1. Write one emotion—like happy, sad, or angry—on each note card, making sure each emotion appears on at least two cards. Students will be looking for others with the same emotion, so the total number of emotions will depend on how many students you want in each group.
2. Allow at least 10 minutes for this activity.

#### Introduction
Present the activity: **Kabuki is a traditional form of Japanese theater where the actors sometimes show their emotions by making exaggerated faces and poses. Today you'll all practice being Kabuki actors by expressing exaggerated emotions silently.**
#### Steps
1. Pass out the emotion note cards to the class. Have students read their cards quietly, without revealing what's written on them.
2. Have students make faces that represent the emotions on their cards.
3. Have students move around the room, looking for others they think are showing the same emotion as them. Students must express their emotions silently using facial expressions.
4. When students think they've found all other students who are showing the same emotion, have them show each other their cards. Students whose cards match can sit down in a group. Those whose cards don't match should continue looking.
5. Once everyone has found a group, have each group create a full-body pose that represents the emotion.
6. Have each group demonstrate the pose, and have the rest of the class try to guess which emotion the group members are showing.
7. Collect the cards and repeat the activity, as time allows.

#### Reflection
1. Have the class reflect quietly about the following prompt:

**What are some similarities between the exaggerated emotions you saw today and the way people express emotions in real life?**
2. Call on students to tell the class their ideas, as time allows.
