#### Introduction
Present the activity: **Many things can cause you to feel stressed or frustrated. Being aware of what those things are and what you can do to handle stress can help you when it happens.**
#### Steps
1. Hand out materials to each group.
2. Have the groups draw a life preserver (a large circle with a smaller circle inside) on their papers. This will be their "Calm Preserver."
3. Outside the Calm Preserver, have groups list or draw pictures of things that cause them stress.
4. Near the stressors, but on the Calm Preserver itself, have students list or draw pictures of things that help them cope with or reduce stress.
5. Have groups show and explain their drawings to the class.

#### Reflection
1. Have the class reflect quietly about the following prompt:

**What's one new strategy to handle stress you heard about today that you might try in the future?**
2. Call on students to tell the class their ideas, as time allows.
