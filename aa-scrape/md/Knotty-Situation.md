#### Introduction
Present the activity: **In this box, there's a rope. In a moment, we'll take it out and pull on it. If the rope pulls straight, you all win! However, if there's a knot in the rope, you all lose. The reward for winning is the knowledge that you won. You must decide what the consequence is for losing.**
#### Steps
1. Give the class 5 minutes to decide what the consequence should be if they lose. The consequence has to be real, and the whole class must agree on it. If anyone disagrees, have the class think of a different consequence.
2. Take the rope out of the box and pick two students to pull on the ends. If there's a knot in the rope, the students will face their chosen consequence.

#### Reflection
1. Have the class reflect quietly about the following prompt:

**What made it difficult to decide on a consequence? How did you overcome those difficulties?**
2. Call on students to tell the class their ideas, as time allows.
