Class Meeting Instructions
#### Warm-Up
Have everyone in the class (including you!) briefly answer the following question:

**People often get mad at each other because of simple misunderstandings that get blown out of proportion. Do you agree or disagree?**
#### Discussion
As a class, discuss one or more of the following prompts, as time allows:


-  **Some people get into more conflicts than others. Why do you think that is?**

-  **Tell us about a time someone got mad at you. What did you do? Do you think you handled it well, or do you wish you'd done something differently?**

-  **What do you think the person who was mad at you was thinking? What was their perspective?**
#### Reflection
Have the class reflect quietly about the following prompt:

**How can thinking about other people's perspectives help you avoid conflicts?**

Call on students to tell the class their ideas, as time allows.
