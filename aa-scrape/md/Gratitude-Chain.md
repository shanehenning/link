#### Introduction
Present the activity: **Today we'll reflect on the things we're grateful for by making a gratitude chain. You'll have the chance to connect your links of gratitude with other students' links, and we'll see how long our chain can grow.**
#### Steps
1. Give each student several strips of construction paper.
2. On each strip, have students write down one thing they're grateful for.
3. Have students use tape or glue to make connected loops from their strips of paper, forming a paper chain with the words on the outside of each loop.
4. Have students connect their chains with the chains of other students until they form one long gratitude chain.
5. Have students look at what's written on the links of the chain. If multiple classes are doing this activity, have students look at what students in other classes wrote.

#### Reflection
1. Have the class reflect quietly about the following prompt:

**How are the things you're grateful for similar to or different from what other students are grateful for?**
2. Call on students to tell the class their ideas, as time allows.
