#### Preparation
1. Have a list ready of staff that students may not know, but who might be good people to go to for help with improving the campus. This list could include teachers with expertise in certain areas; office, administrative, or custodial staff; or outside service providers working with the school.
2. If multiple classes are collaborating, plan time for them to come together to work.
3. If this project has been done before, have a list ready of previous campus improvement projects that students can refer to if they need ideas.

#### Project Description

### Project Description

Taking pride in your campus is a great way to feel engaged in your school community. In this Service-Learning Project, students will first identify parts of the school campus they think would most benefit from improvement (for example, improving the cafeteria, updating ADA ramps, weeding flower beds, adding more bicycle racks, or building a garden). Then students will choose one project, investigate whom at school and in the community can help, and create a plan to make it happen. Students can extend the plan to include ongoing upkeep.

Individual classes can choose their own projects, or multiple classes can work together on improving one part of the campus.

Project Steps
#### Investigation
The class will create a list of physical areas of the campus that could use improvement. This list can be created in a number of ways, including:


-  Class brainstorm

-  Interviewing older students and/or staff

-  Polling students in different classes

If the students identify an overwhelming number of campus areas in need of improvement, they may have to prioritize them and choose the most important one to focus on.
#### Planning
After choosing a campus area to focus on, students will create a plan for identifying whom to go to for help in improving that area. If there are any special requirements for their chosen improvement project (for example, from the district), students will need to incorporate that into their plan. Next, students will decide what pieces of the project must be addressed in what order, how they will execute the improvement project (for example, a community work party), and whether they will need to raise any funds for materials. Finally, students will need to create a schedule and assign people to complete each part of the project.
#### Action
Students will put their plan into action. They'll determine the timeline or refer to the schedule part of the plan and begin. They'll also check the schedule frequently to ensure everyone is on task and meeting milestones.
#### Reflection
Students will reflect on what they've learned throughout this process, how what they've done will help all students at school, what challenges they faced, and how they overcame these challenges.
#### Demonstration
Students will hold a grand unveiling of their project (for example, a ribbon-cutting ceremony or other small ceremony in the improved area). If possible, give students the opportunity to formally present their project to peers, staff, or families, and describe how they went about creating it.
