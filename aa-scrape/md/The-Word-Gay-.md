Class Meeting Instructions
#### Warm-Up
Read the following scenario to the class:

**John wrote on a wall in the bathroom that Tyler is gay. Tyler gets angry and tells his friends that John is the one who's actually gay. John's friends start teasing him, and now he doesn't want to come to school anymore.**

Have everyone in the class (including you!) briefly answer the following question:

**Who is the victim in this story? Who did something wrong?**
#### Discussion
As a class, discuss one or more of the following prompts, as time allows:


-  **Why is the word "gay" often used as a put-down?**

-  **Would it be okay to tease Tyler or John if one of them were actually gay?**

-  **Everyone deserves to feel safe here at school, including people who are gay. How could just hearing the word "gay" used as a put-down make people who are gay feel unsafe?**
#### Reflection
Have the class reflect quietly about the following prompt:

**What's one thing you could do to help people who identify as gay feel safe and welcome here at school?**

Call on students to tell the class their ideas, as time allows.
