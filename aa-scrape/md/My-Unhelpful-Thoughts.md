-  **Are there things you're not good at and think you won't be able to do?**

-  **Tell us about something that was difficult for you to learn but became easier as you got better. What did you think about yourself when you first started learning it? What do you think about yourself now?**

-  **Why can it be difficult to learn something new? How can the thoughts in your head cause you to give up?**
#### Reflection
Have the class reflect quietly about the following prompt:

**When you're struggling to learn something new, what can you tell yourself to stop yourself from giving up?**
