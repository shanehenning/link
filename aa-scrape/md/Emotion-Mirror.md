Activity Instructions
#### Introduction
Present the activity: **Today we're going to play a game where we mirror each other's emotions.**
#### Steps
1. Have each pair of students designate one partner as Partner A and the other as Partner B.
2. For practice, have Partner A begin by making a slow physical motion, like waving a hand or walking in place. Then have Partner B mirror what Partner A is doing.
3. Have Partner A choose an emotion and make motions that demonstrate that emotion, while Partner B mirrors. There should be no talking.
4. After 30 seconds, have the partners switch roles. This time, Partner B makes motions that demonstrate an emotion, while Partner A mirrors. There should be no talking during the mirroring portion of this activity.
5. Have the partners stop mirroring and each guess what the other was trying to show.
          Repeat Steps 3 to 5, as time allows.

#### Reflection
1. Have the class reflect quietly about the following prompt:

**How did mirroring your partner's emotions make you feel? Do you think you experience emotions the same way your partner does?**
2. Call on students to tell the class their ideas, as time allows.
