#### Preparation
1. Have an employee directory or contact list ready to help students expand their investigation.
2. If multiple classes are collaborating, plan time for them to come together to work.
3. If this project has been done before, have a copy of the old service guide ready for students to refer to. Make note of any staff members who are no longer at the school.

#### Project Description

### Project Description

Being helpful to others at school is an important part of building community and taking ownership. One way to be helpful at school is to assist school staff members (for example, teachers; office, administrative, or custodial staff; or outside service providers working at the school) with specific tasks.

In this Service-Learning Project, students will identify tasks they think staff members will most likely need help with throughout the school year (for example, cleaning classrooms, filing papers, technical assistance, and setting up lessons). Then they'll investigate what tasks staff members actually need help with and create a service guide listing these tasks that other students can use to find opportunities to help out. Individual classes can create their own service guides, or multiple classes can work together to create a single service guide for the whole school to use.

If this project has been done before, students can revise and update the old service guide to reflect new tasks and changes to the needs of teachers or staff members.

Project Steps
#### Investigation
Students will create a list of issues or tasks that staff may need assistance with, or things students in a particular class might need help with. This list can be created in a number of ways, including:


-  Class brainstorm

-  Interviewing or polling teachers, other staff members (counselors, principals, secretaries), or other students

-  Drawing from their own experiences

If students identify an overwhelming number of needs, they may have to prioritize them and choose the most important ones to include in their guide.
#### Planning
Students will create a plan for:


-  Identifying the tasks teachers or staff members may need help with

-  Deciding what format they want to use for their guide

-  How they'll produce the guide (for example, pen and paper, printed document, or website)

-  Whether they'll include visuals along with the text

-  Creating a schedule and assigning people to complete each part of the project
#### Action
Students will put their plan into action. They'll determine the timeline or refer to the schedule part of the plan and begin. They'll also check the schedule frequently to ensure everyone is on task and meeting milestones.
#### Reflection
Students will reflect on what they've learned throughout this process, how what they've done will help teachers and staff members at school, what challenges they faced, and how they overcame these challenges.
#### Demonstration
Students will make their guide available for other students and staff to refer to (for example, by printing and distributing copies or putting the guide up on the school website). If possible, give students the opportunity to present their guide formally to the school (for example, at a staff meeting or assembly), and describe how they went about creating it.
