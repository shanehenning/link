#### Introduction
Present the activity: **We'll be spending some time getting to know each other today. I'll divide you into two groups and give each of you a note card. When you get the card, you'll write five little-known facts about yourself on one side. I'll read each card out loud, and each group will try to guess who in the other group the facts describe.**
#### Steps
1. Have the two groups face each other.
2. Give each student a blank note card and have students write five little-known facts about themselves on their cards. (For example, I was born in Zurich. My favorite food is cabbage. My grandmother's name is Opal).
3. Collect the cards, keeping the cards from each group in separate piles.
4. Draw a card from one group's pile and read the first fact on it.
5. Have the opposite group try to guess which person the card describes. If they don't guess correctly on the first try, read the next fact and have them guess again. Continue down the card until they guess correctly or you run out of facts.
6. Groups get 5 points if they guess correctly on the first fact, 4 for the second fact, 3 for the third, and so on. Keep score on a piece of scratch paper, or have students keep score.
7. Play as many rounds as time allows, making sure you've read the same number of cards from both groups.
8. Add up the scores. The group with the most points wins.

#### Reflection
1. Have the class reflect quietly about the following prompt:

**What were some things you learned about others today that really surprised you?**
2. Call on students to tell the class their ideas, as time allows.
