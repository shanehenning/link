#### Project Description

### Project Description

Sexual and gender harassment is a problem in many communities. In this project, students will work to reduce sexual or gender harassment so everyone in their community can feel safe and accepted.

In this Service-Learning Project, students will identify the effects sexual and gender harassment have on people in the community. Then students will investigate ways they can help support people who experience sexual or gender harassment (for example, starting a public awareness campaign, writing letters to newspapers, or supporting a community organization). Finally, students will take steps to help support people in the community who are experiencing sexual or gender harassment.

Project Steps
#### Investigation
First, have students consider the causes of sexual and gender harassment and the effects it may have on people in the community. This list can be created in a number of ways, including:


-  Class brainstorm

-  Interviewing community members or social service organizations

-  Researching the effects of sexual and gender harassment

Then have students work with community members to identify what they can do to stand up against sexual and gender harassment.
#### Planning
Once students have decided what actions they want to take, they'll create a plan for how to accomplish the project. This plan should include setting goals and timelines, and assigning roles and tasks to specific students.
#### Action
Students will put their plan into action. They'll determine the timeline or refer to the schedule part of the plan and begin. They'll also check the schedule frequently to ensure everyone is on task and meeting milestones.
#### Reflection
Students will reflect on what they've learned throughout this process, how what they've done will reduce sexual or gender harassment and help people feel safe and supported, what challenges they faced, and how they overcame these challenges.
#### Demonstration
If the students have chosen to do something that can be observed (such as lead a rally after school), have students invite friends, family, and community members to observe them completing the project. Otherwise, have students present their project to school staff or community members.
