#### Introduction
Present the activity: **Today we're going to get to know each other a bit better. In a moment, I'm going to ask you all to line up in a specific order. There's only one rule: You have to be completely silent while you sort yourselves out.**
#### Steps
1. Have students line up at the front of the room, shortest to tallest. Make sure students stay completely silent.
2. Have students sort themselves again based on different criteria. You can use easy criteria (for example, shoe size or hand size) or more difficult criteria (for example, the first letter of students' middle names or their birthdays).
3. You can also have students sort themselves into groups, such as their favorite ice cream flavor or musical group.
4. Repeat Steps 2 and/or 3, as time allows.
5. (Optional) Time the class and see how long they take to sort themselves. Have students try and beat their previous time, or compare times with other classes to see which class is the Silent Icebreaker champion.

#### Reflection
1. Have the class reflect quietly about the following prompt:

**What was the hardest part about trying to sort yourselves without talking? What did you think of to make it easier?**
2. Call on students to tell the class their ideas, as time allows.
