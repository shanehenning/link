#### Introduction
Present the activity: **You're going to work in pairs to make a plan for a "road trip" to a local area. You'll need to decide where you want to go, how you'll get there and back, what you'll do while you're there, and what you want to bring back to show your classmates.**
#### Steps
1. Hand out materials to each pair of students.
2. Have each pair decide where they want to go on their road trip and mark their destinations on the map.
3. Have students plan how they'll get to and from their destination(s) and what they'll do for meals while they're gone.
4. Have students decide what they'll bring back from the trip to show their classmates (for example, a souvenir from a shop or a piece of art they made).
5. Have each pair tell the class about the road trip they planned.

#### Reflection
1. Have the class reflect quietly about the following prompt:

**How difficult was it to figure out a plan that both of you could agree on? Would this have been easier or harder to do if you were working alone?**
2. Call on students to tell the class their ideas, as time allows.
