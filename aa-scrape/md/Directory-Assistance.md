#### Preparation
1. To help students with their investigation, have a list ready of staff that new students may not know, but who might be good people to go to for help. It could include teachers in other grades; office, administrative, or custodial staff; or outside service providers working at the school.
2. If multiple classes are collaborating, plan time for them to come together to work.
3. If this project has been done before, have a copy of the old directory ready for students to refer to. Make note of any students or staff who are no longer at the school.

#### Project Description

### Project Description

Learning whom to go to for help at school is an important part of making the transition to middle school. However, students will need help with different problems in different classes, and the best person to help with one problem may not be the best person to help with another.

In this Service-Learning Project, students will identify the problems they think they're most likely to need help with (for example, opening lockers, finding classes, getting homework done, making friends, or staying out of trouble). Then students will investigate who the best people at school are to ask for help with each problem, such as a particular teacher, counselor, administrator, or another student. Finally, students will create a directory listing all the people at school who are available to help and what kind of help they can give. Individual classes can create their own directories, or multiple classes can work together to create a single directory for all students to use.

If this project has been done before, students can revise and update the old directory to reflect new concerns, as well as any changes in the staff and student body.

Project Steps
#### Investigation
Students will create a list of issues they commonly need help with. This list can be created in a number of ways, including:


-  Class brainstorm

-  Interviewing older students and/or staff

-  Polling students in different classes

If the students identify an overwhelming number of issues, they may have to prioritize them and choose the most important ones to include.
#### Planning
Students will create a plan for:


-  Identifying whom to go to for help with each issue they've chosen to include

-  What format they want to use for the directory

-  How they'll produce the directory (for example, pen and paper, printed document, or website)

-  Whether they'll include visuals along with the text

-  Creating a schedule and assigning students to complete each part of the project
#### Action
Students will put their plan into action. They'll determine the timeline or refer to the schedule part of the plan and begin. They'll also check the schedule frequently to ensure everyone is on task and meeting milestones.
#### Reflection
Students will reflect on what they've learned throughout the process of creating the directory, how what they did will help others at school, what challenges they faced, and how they overcame these challenges.
#### Demonstration
Students will make their directory available for others to use (for example, by printing and distributing copies, or putting the directory up on the school website). If possible, give students the opportunity to present their directory formally to peers, staff, or families, and describe how they went about creating it.
