#### Warm-Up
Have everyone in the class (including you!) briefly answer the following question: 

**Describe one thing that is almost guaranteed to make you angry if it happens to you.**
#### Discussion
As a class, discuss one or more of the following prompts, as time allows:


-  **Things that frequently make you feel strong emotions are called triggers. What are some triggers that make you feel other emotions, like anxiety, happiness, or sadness?**

-  **Is there certain body language that can be a trigger for you?**

-  **How do you react to your triggers? Can you recognize a trigger before it affects your emotions? What do you do if you think you might encounter a trigger?**
#### Reflection
Have the class reflect quietly about the following prompt:

**What can you do when you encounter a trigger to make sure you don't do something you'll regret later?**

Call on students to tell the class their ideas, as time allows.
