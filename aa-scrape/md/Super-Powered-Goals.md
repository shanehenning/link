#### Introduction
Present the activity: **Today you're going to think about goals you have for things you want to do now and in the future.**
#### Steps
1. Say:

** Imagine you're a superhero. Not a supervillain, but a superhero. What's your superpower, and how would you use it to make life better for the people around you?**
2. Give students think-time, then have them tell the class what they imagined.
3. Put students in pairs or groups with others who have similar ideas about their superpowers.
4. Say:

** Unfortunately, you don't have superpowers (that we know of, anyway). With your partner(s), think of what you'll need to do to achieve your goals without the help of superpowers.**
5. After students have identified what they'll need to do to meet their goals, have them identify smaller goals they can achieve right now that will get them started on the road to meeting their larger goals.
6. Have each pair or group tell the class their large and small goals.

#### Reflection
1. Have the class reflect quietly about the following prompt:

**Creating goals is only the first step. Pick one of your small goals and think of an If!&amp;-&amp;!Then Plan to help you achieve it.**

If necessary, remind students that in an If!&amp;-&amp;!Then Plan:

**If** is a specific cue you can react to quickly.

**Then** is a specific action or actions you can do immediately.
2. (Optional) Write a sample If–Then Plan on the board using the following format:

**Goal: **______________________

**If (or when) **______________________,

**Then **______________________.
3. Call on students to tell the class their ideas, as time allows.
