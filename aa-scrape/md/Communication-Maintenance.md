Class Meeting Instructions
#### Warm-Up
Tell the class: **Today we're going to discuss questions from ParenTeenConnect.org. These questions can help you and your parents or caregivers find out what you think about communication.**
#### Discussion
As a class, discuss one or more of the following prompts, as time allows:


-  **Is there anything you've done or said to a parent or caregiver that you regretted later? Why?**

-  **What can lead you to do or say things that you regret later?**

-  **When it's the "heat of the moment," how can you prevent yourself from saying or doing something you'll regret later?**
#### Reflection
Have the class reflect quietly about the following prompt:

**How do you think your parents would answer these questions?**

Call on students to tell the class their ideas, as time allows.

Send parents/caregivers a link to ParenTeenConnect.org.

Have students and their caregivers select one of the videos to watch together and discuss, then have students report back during your next meeting.
