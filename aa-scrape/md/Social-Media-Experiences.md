Class Meeting Instructions
#### Warm-Up
Have everyone in the class (including you!) briefly answer the following questions:
          


-  **Who here has one social media account? Who has two? Three or more?**

-  **What do you enjoy about using social media?**<br/>(I can keep in touch with friends who live far away. I can find out what's going on with people.)
#### Discussion
As a class, discuss one or more of the following prompts, as time allows:


-  **How can you use your social media profiles to show your values?**

-  **What can make a social media experience negative?**

-  **Do you think it's easier for people to be mean to each other online than it is in person?**
#### Reflection
Have the class reflect quietly about the following prompt:

**Think of one to two things you can do online to make using social media better for you and your friends.**

Call on students to tell the class their ideas, as time allows.
