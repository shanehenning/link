#### Project Description

### Project Description

Learning how to interact positively at school is an important part of creating a successful learning community. In this Service-Learning Project, students will first identify the types of relationships they have at school (for example, peer-to-peer, student-to-teacher, player-to-coach, or friend-to-friend). Next, students will investigate people, practices, and services that can help them establish and maintain positive relationships at school. Finally, students will create a resource, project, or program that communicates strategies that help create and maintain positive relationships at school.

Individual classes can create their own projects, or multiple classes can work together to create a single resource for all students. If this project has been done before, students can revise and update an old project to reflect new concerns.

Project Steps
#### Investigation
Students will create a list of common relationships at school. This list can be created in a number of ways, including:


-  Class brainstorm

-  Interviewing older students and/or staff

-  Polling students in different classes
#### Planning
Students will create a plan to identify ways of establishing and maintaining positive relationships at school. They may draw from their own experiences, interview others, or research common positive relationship-building strategies. Students will also have to decide how they want to share the resources and strategies they come up with (for example, an online resource, schoolwide event, or schoolwide campaign), how they will create the project, and what details will need to be included. Finally, students will need to create a schedule and assign people to complete each part of the project.
#### Action
Students will put their plan into action. They'll determine the timeline or refer to the schedule part of the plan and begin. They'll also check the schedule frequently to ensure everyone is on task and meeting milestones.
#### Reflection
Students will reflect on what they've learned throughout this process, how what they've done will help all students at school, what challenges they faced, and how they overcame these challenges.
#### Demonstration
If possible, give students the opportunity to formally present their project to a wider audience, whether in person or online, and describe how they went about creating it.
