#### Activity Instructions
Activity Instructions
#### Introduction
Present the activity: **Today you're going to get to know each other a little bit better. Each of you will think of a way to describe yourself in 30 seconds or less. Then you'll take turns describing yourself and listening to others' describe themselves. When we're done, you may discover there's someone in this class you'd like to get to know better.**
#### Steps
1. Seat the students in two rows, facing each other.
2. Have students think quietly of a way to describe themselves in 30 seconds or less. They could include things they like to do, what they value most, or what makes them a good friend.
3. Give the students in one row 30 seconds to tell the person opposite them their self-descriptions. When time is up, switch.
4. Have the students in the other row describe themselves in 30 seconds.
5. After students from both rows have spoken, have all the students stand up and move one chair to the right. Students at the end of a row should move to the beginning of the same row.
6. Continue Steps 3 to 5, as time allows.

#### Reflection
1. Have the class reflect quietly about the following prompt:

**Is there a student you'd like to get to know better based on what you heard today? What did he or she say that caught your interest?**
2. Call on students to tell the class their ideas, as time allows.
