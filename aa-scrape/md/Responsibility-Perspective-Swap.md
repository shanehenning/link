#### Introduction
Present the activity: **Today we're going to watch teens and parents responding to questions about responsibility. You'll split into 2 groups: "teens" and "parents." Then your group will respond to discussion questions from the perspective you were assigned. **
#### Steps
1. In the list of videos, navigate to the section "Responsibility Conflicts." Play the video "Real Voices: What responsibilities do parents and teens argue about?"
2. Have one group of students be the "parents" and the other group be the "teens."
3. Have the groups discuss the following questions from their assigned perspectives:
            
What do you argue with your teen or parent about?
What responsibilities do you think teens should have? Are there any they shouldn't have?
4. If time allows, navigate to the section "Responsibility Pros and Cons" and play the video "Real Voices: What's good about having more responsibility?"
5. Have the groups switch perspectives and discuss the following questions:
            
What's good about having responsibility?
In what ways can having more responsibility give you more freedom?
6. Send parents/caregivers a link to ParenTeenConnect.org.
7. Have students and their caregivers select one of the videos to watch together and discuss, then have students report back during your next meeting.

#### Reflection
1. Have the class reflect quietly about the following prompt:

**How did it feel to take the perspective of a parent?**
2. Call on students to tell the class their ideas, as time allows.
