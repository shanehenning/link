#### Introduction
Present the activity: **You're going to work in groups to create a portrait of the ultimate friend. Each of you will think of one or two traits a good friend of yours has. Then your group will draw a single person—the Ultimate Friend—that represents all the traits your group came up with. This person doesn't need to look realistic. We just need to see each trait represented visually.**
#### Steps
1. Have students quietly think of one or two traits a good friend of theirs has.
2. Hand out materials to each group.
3. Have the groups draw a simple stick figure, without details, on their papers, using the drawing on the board as a model.
4. Have the groups create their portraits by embellishing the stick figure with details that represent the traits they chose. All group members can work together, drawing at the same time.
5. When the portraits are done, have each group present its Ultimate Friend and tell the class which traits are represented.
6. (Optional) Hang the portraits in the classroom or hall.

#### Reflection
1. Have the class reflect quietly about the following prompt:

**What are some traits you heard multiple groups mention? Why do you think these traits are so common?**
2. Call on students to tell the class their ideas, as time allows.
