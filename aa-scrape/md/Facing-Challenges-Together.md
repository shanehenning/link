Class Meeting Instructions
#### Warm-Up
Have everyone in the class (including you!) briefly answer the following question:

**Why do you think people are afraid of trying things that are challenging?**

(They don't want to make mistakes. They don't want to step out of their comfort zones.)
#### Discussion
As a class, discuss one or more of the following prompts, as time allows:


-  **Think about your time in middle school so far. What's the most challenging thing you've had to do? Did anyone help you through it?**

-  **Agree or disagree: "People should handle challenges alone." Explain your thinking.**

-  **How can you support people who are trying something challenging?**
#### Reflection
Have the class reflect quietly about the following prompt:

**What are three ways you can support your friends when they're trying something challenging?**

Call on students to tell the class their ideas, as time allows.
