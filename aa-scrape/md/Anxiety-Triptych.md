#### Introduction
Present the activity: **A triptych is a set of three illustrations that tell a story. Today, each of you will create your own triptychs about anxiety.**
#### Steps
1. Hand out materials to students.
2. Have students create a picture that represents how they feel when they're anxious, or something that can cause them to feel anxious or stressed. These illustrations can be in any form, and can be realistic or abstract.
3. On a separate piece of paper, have students create a picture that represents what they do to stay calm when they're feeling anxious, using the same style as the first picture.
4. On a third piece of paper, have students create a picture that represents how they feel after they've calmed down, or what it looks like when they're no longer anxious, using the same style as before.
5. Have students show their triptychs to the class.

#### Reflection
1. Have the class reflect quietly about the following prompt:

**What are some similarities you see between your triptych and someone else's? Why do you think these similarities exist?**
2. Call on students to tell the class their ideas, as time allows.
