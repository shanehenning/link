#### Introduction
Present the activity: **Crowdsourcing is when someone asks a lot of people the same question and sorts through all the responses to figure out the best answer. Today you'll use the power of crowdsourcing to address concerns you have about transitioning to high school.**
#### Steps
1. Have the class sit in a circle.
2. Have each person think of a concern he or she has about transitioning to high school and write it at the top of a sheet of paper. For example, "I'm worried I won't know anyone," or "How do teachers grade in high school?"
3. After students have written down their concerns, have each student pass his or her paper to the right.
4. Have each student read the concern he or she received, then write down answers or advice. Give students 1 minute to respond.
5. After 1 minute, have students pass their sheets of paper to the right again, and write down advice or answers on the papers they've just received.
6. Continue until each paper has been returned to its original owner, or as time allows.

#### Reflection
1. Have the class reflect quietly about the following prompt:

**What's the best advice you received? Why do you think it's the best?**
2. Call on students to tell the class their ideas, as time allows.
