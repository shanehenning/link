#### Preparation
1. Have a list ready of organizations that are active in the community to help students expand their investigation (for example, animal shelters, food banks, Boys and Girls Clubs).
2. If multiple classes are collaborating, plan time for them to come together to work.
3. If this project has been done before, have a copy of the old volunteer guide for students to refer to. Make note of any volunteer organizations that are no longer seeking help or that have made changes to their volunteer process.

#### Project Description

### Project Description

Volunteering to help people outside of school is an important part of building community and taking ownership. But in order to be helpful, students need to know which community organizations are looking for volunteers.

In this Service-Learning Project, students will identify service organizations in their community. Then they will investigate which of those organizations are seeking volunteers, the process for becoming a volunteer, and the guidelines for being a volunteer (for example, age or time commitment). Then students will create a volunteer guide listing all the organizations they've found that are seeking volunteers and the process for becoming one. Individual classes can create their own volunteer guides, or multiple classes can work together to create a single guide all students can use.

If this project has been done before, students can revise and update the old volunteer guide to reflect changes to organizations or the process of becoming a volunteer.

Project Steps
#### Investigation
Students will create a list of organizations seeking volunteers. This list can be created in a number of ways, including:


-  Class brainstorm

-  Calling organizations to find out their needs and the process for becoming a volunteer

-  Interviewing older students, staff, and parents who have volunteered or have knowledge of the volunteer process

-  Drawing from their own experience

-  Researching online
#### Planning
Students will create a plan for:


-  Identifying organizations that are seeking volunteers in the community

-  Deciding on the format for the volunteer guide

-  How they will produce it (for example, pen and paper, printed document, or website)

-  Whether they'll include visuals with the text

-  Creating a schedule and assigning people to complete each part of the project
#### Action
Students will put their plan into action. They'll determine the timeline or refer to the schedule part of the plan and begin. They'll also check the schedule frequently to ensure everyone is on task and meeting milestones.
#### Reflection
Students will reflect on what they've learned throughout this process, how what they've done will help other students at school, what challenges they faced, and how they overcame these challenges.
#### Demonstration
Students will make their volunteer guides available for others (for example, by printing and distributing copies of the volunteer guide or putting it up on the school website). If possible, give students the opportunity to present their volunteer guide formally to their peers and describe how they went about creating it.
