#### Project Description

### Project Description

Students' need for help doesn't always end with the school day. In this Service-Learning Project, students will brainstorm issues they might need help with outside of school, such as academics, getting ready for a career or college, or family-specific issues. Then students will identify people or organizations outside of school who can help, such as community centers, local nonprofits, or trusted community members. Then students will choose one organization they have identified and create a plan to help it fulfill its mission and help students.

Project Steps
#### Investigation
Students will create a list of issues that come up outside of school and that students may need help with. This list can be created in a number of ways, including:


-  Class brainstorm

-  Interviewing older students and/or staff

-  Polling students in different classes

Divide students into groups and have each group investigate what people or organizations in their community are available to help with the issues they've identified. Then have each group present their findings, and as a class, pick one person or organization to support.
#### Planning
Students will create a plan to assist their chosen person or organization in fulfilling its mission. This plan will vary depending on the organization and what students want to do, but could include gathering donations, writing letters to politicians, or simply raising awareness about the organization. Students should at least do the following:


-  Before making a plan, contact the organization and find out what its needs are

-  Keep in mind the amount of time and resources they have available for this project when creating their plan

Finally, students will need to create a schedule and assign people to complete each part of the project.
#### Action
Students will put their plan into action. They'll determine the timeline or refer to the schedule part of the plan and begin. They'll also check the schedule frequently to ensure everyone is on task and meeting milestones.
#### Reflection
Students will reflect on what they've learned throughout this process, what their successes and challenges were, and how they have helped other students.
#### Demonstration
Students will formally present the results of their project. This may be the culmination of their plan, or it may happen after their plan is completed. If possible, give students the opportunity to present the project formally to peers, staff, or families who were not involved.
