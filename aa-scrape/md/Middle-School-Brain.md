Class Meeting Instructions
#### Warm-Up
Have everyone in the class (including you!) briefly answer the following question: 

**Learning new things helps your brain get stronger. Name one thing you've learned since starting middle school.**<br/>
            (Math. A sport. Juggling.)
#### Discussion
As a class, discuss one or more of the following prompts, as time allows:


-  **Tell us about something new you've learned in middle school. How did it feel to learn something new?**

-  **Tell us about a something you've learned recently outside of school. How did it feel to learn something new?**

-  **Tell us about something that used to seem really difficult or impossible to do, but is now easy for you. How did that change happen?**
#### Reflection
Have the class reflect quietly about the following prompt:

**What's something you're learning right now—in school or outside of school—that's making your brain stronger?**

Call on students to tell the class their ideas, as time allows.
