#### Introduction
Present the activity: **Today we'll be having a rubber band race. Each group will stand in a circle and pass the rubber band from person to person without dropping it. You may only use straws to touch the rubber band. If the rubber band falls on the ground, you have to start over again with the first person in the circle. It may be challenging, but that's okay. Try your best, and work together.**
#### Steps
1. Have each group stand in a circle.
2. Give each group a rubber band and each student a straw.
3. Have students hold the straws in their mouths. (If students don't feel comfortable with this, they can use their hands instead.)
4. Have students pass the rubber band around the circle using only the straws.
5. The group that gets the rubber band around the circle the fastest wins.
6. To add more of a challenge, have students pass two rubber bands at a time, or have multiple rubber bands circling at the same time.

#### Reflection
1. Have the class reflect quietly about the following prompt:

**What emotions did you experience playing this game? How did you handle those emotions?**
2. Call on students to tell the class their ideas, as time allows.
