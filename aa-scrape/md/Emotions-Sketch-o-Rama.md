#### Introduction
Present the activity: **Today we'll be playing Emotions Sketch-o-Rama. Groups will race to be the first to identify emotions drawn by their group members.**
#### Steps
1. Have each group choose one person to be the sketcher.
2. Have the sketchers come to the front of the class.
3. Draw one emotion note card and show it to the sketchers, but nobody else.
4. Have the sketchers return to their groups without speaking.
5. When you say "Go!" have the sketchers start drawing images that represent the emotion, without talking or writing any words.
6. The first group to guess what emotion the sketcher is drawing wins the round.
7. Have the groups pick a new sketcher and repeat Steps 3 to 5, as time allows.

#### Reflection
1. Have the class reflect quietly about the following prompt:

**Why do different people choose different ways to represent the same emotion? In real life, do people think differently about what emotions mean? Why?**
2. Call on students to tell the class their ideas, as time allows.
