#### Introduction
Present the activity: **Today we're going to watch teens and parents responding to questions about screen time. You'll split into 2 groups: "teens" and "parents." Then your group will respond to discussion questions from the perspective you were assigned. **
#### Steps
1. In the list of videos, navigate to the section "Time Spent Online." Play the video "Real Voices: How much screen time is okay?"
2. Have one group of students be the "parents" and the other group be the "teens."
3. Have the groups discuss the following questions from their assigned perspectives:
            
How much screen time do you use?
How much screen time is too much?
4. If time allows, navigate to the section "Online Privacy" and play the video "Real Voices: How much online privacy should teens get?"
5. Have the groups switch perspectives and discuss the following questions:
            
What is okay and what is not okay to share online?
Is snooping ever okay? Why or why not?
6. Send parents/caregivers a link to ParenTeenConnect.org.
7. Have students and their caregivers select one of the videos to watch together and discuss, then have students report back during your next meeting.

#### Reflection
1. Have the class reflect quietly about the following prompt:

**How did it feel to take the perspective of a parent?**
2. Call on students to tell the class their ideas, as time allows.
