#### Warm-Up
Have everyone in the class (including you!) briefly answer the following question: 

**How does it feel when you're in the middle of a conflict?**<br/>

-  **Compare how you feel during a conflict to how you feel afterward. What's different?**

-  **Why is it difficult to calm down when in a conflict?**

-  **If you see a conflict starting between other people, what can you do to help calm the situation?**
#### Reflection
Have the class reflect quietly about the following prompt:

**What can you do the next time you're in a conflict to keep the situation calm?**

Call on students to tell the class their ideas, as time allows.
