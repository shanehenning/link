Activity Instructions
#### Introduction
Present the activity: **Today you're all going to take an anonymous survey about what's okay and what's not okay in a dating relationship. Do not write your name on these surveys. After you fill them out, I will collect them, shuffle them, and redistribute them. You won't know whose survey you have.**

**Think carefully about each statement on the survey, and check the box that matches your own opinion.**
#### Steps
1. Pass out the surveys and give students a few minutes to complete them.
2. Have students crumple up their surveys, then collect all the surveys in a bag.
3. Distribute the surveys randomly to students and have them un-crumple the papers.
4. Read the first survey question, then have students move to the side of the room that represents the answer on the survey they're holding (not their own).
5. Discuss with students why they think people answered the way they did, and why each item might or might not be okay.
6. Repeat Steps 4 and 5 for the rest of the survey questions.

#### Reflection
1. Have the class reflect quietly about the following prompt:

**Based on the survey results, how do you think most people in this class want to be treated by someone they're dating?**
2. Call on students to tell the class their ideas, as time allows.
