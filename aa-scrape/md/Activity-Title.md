#### Warm-Up
Have everyone in the class (including you!) briefly answer the following question: 

**In one word, describe how you'll feel this time next year, when you're starting high school.**<br/>
            (Excited. Scared. Anxious. Overwhelmed. Happy.)
#### Discussion
As a class, discuss one or more of the following prompts, as time allows:


-  **When you think about high school, what makes you nervous? Do you think younger students starting at this school feel the same way?**

-  **What worries you about the older students at high school? Do you think younger students here think the same way about you?**

-  **What could the older students at high school do to make you feel welcome? What could you do to make younger students feel welcome?**
#### Reflection
Have the class reflect quietly about the following prompt:

**How has this discussion changed how you think about the younger students here?**

Call on students to tell the class their ideas, as time allows.
