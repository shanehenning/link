Activity Instructions
#### Introduction
Present the activity: **Today you're going to work together to solve a difficult design challenge. As you do this activity, notice what thoughts you have.**
#### Steps
1. Have each group stand together on a separate blanket or tarp.
2. Explain the rules:
            
Your challenge is for your group to work together to flip this blanket over without anyone getting off it.
You're not competing against the other groups.
As soon as everyone in your group is standing on the opposite side of the blanket, you win.
If anyone touches the floor, a wall, or any piece of furniture (or if the butcher paper rips), you lose.
You have 1 minute to complete this challenge, starting now!
3. Start the timer.
4. It's okay to stop the timer to answer questions. Just remind students how much time they have remaining. To build tension, count down the seconds.
5. After 1 minute, or after students complete the challenge, have the class reflect about the following question:

** What thoughts went through your head when I told you to start? How did your thoughts affect how you acted during the challenge?**
6. Give students another chance to complete the challenge, but this time, have them take as much time as they need.
7. Have the class reflect about the following question:

** How did having as much time as you needed change your thoughts? How did that change the way you acted?**
8. Finally, have students try again with a 1 minute time limit. When they're done, have the class reflect about the following question:

** Compare your thoughts from the first time you did this to the last time. How are they different? Why are they different?**

#### Reflection
1. Have the class reflect quietly about the following prompt:

**How does stress affect your thoughts? What can you do when you have negative thoughts in a stressful situation?**
2. Call on students to tell the class their ideas, as time allows.
