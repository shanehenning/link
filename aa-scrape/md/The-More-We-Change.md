#### Warm-Up
Have everyone in the class (including you!) briefly answer the following question:

**Pick one word that describes who you are right now, and one word that describes who you were five years ago.**<br/> 
              (Loud and shy. Funny and goofy. Mature and immature.)
#### Discussion
As a class, discuss one or more of the following prompts, as time allows:


-  **How is your personality changing as you mature? What do you think of the person you're becoming?**

-  **Tell us about someone you know whose personality has changed. What do you think of the person he or she is becoming?**

-  **You can help your personality change. Tell us about one part of your personality you'd like to change. What do you think you could do to make that happen?**
#### Reflection
Have the class reflect quietly about the following prompt:

**How has this conversation changed the way you think about yourself or someone else?**
