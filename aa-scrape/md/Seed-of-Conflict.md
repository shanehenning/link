Class Meeting Instructions
#### Warm-Up
Have everyone in the class (including you!) briefly answer the following question: 

**What are some things that can cause conflicts between students?**<br/>
            (Gossip. Dating relationships. Insults or disrespect.)
#### Discussion
As a class, discuss one or more of the following prompts, as time allows:


-  **Big conflicts often start from little disagreements. Tell us about a conflict you were in. What was the little thing that started it?**

-  **Think about a big conflict you were in. What could you have done early on to keep it from getting big? What stopped you from doing that?**

-  **Think of a big conflict you were in. What could the other person or people involved have done to keep it from getting big? What stopped them from doing that?**
#### Reflection
Have the class reflect quietly about the following prompt:

**The next time you get into a disagreement with someone, what's one thing you might do differently to keep the conflict from growing?**

Call on students to tell the class their ideas, as time allows.
