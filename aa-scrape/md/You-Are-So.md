Activity Instructions
#### Introduction
Present the activity: **Today we'll be doing an activity to see the effects that labels have on us and other people. First, you'll have a random label attached to your forehead. Then you'll socialize with others in class, but you have to speak to and treat them according to their labels. Then you'll each try to guess what label you had.**
#### Steps
1. Stick a random sticky note label to each student's forehead.
2. Have students spend 10 minutes circulating the room and talking with others about a general topic, such as future goals, values, or how school is going. Make sure they talk to several different people.
3. Have students treat each person they talk to according to his or her label. For example, they might work science into a discussion with someone labeled "good at science." Tell students not to reveal to the people they talk to what their labels are.
4. After 10 minutes, reconvene the class and have students guess what their labels were.

#### Reflection
1. Have the class reflect quietly about the following prompt:

**How would this game have been different if the labels had been negative, like "dumb," "mean," or "lazy"?**
2. Call on students to tell the class their ideas, as time allows.
