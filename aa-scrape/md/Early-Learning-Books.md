#### Preparation

Have a list ready of local early learning centers and books for young children, or schedule time for your students to meet with a children's librarian. If this project has been done before, have examples and past ideas available for students to refer to as examples.

#### Project Description

### Project Description

When people feel positive about themselves and their community, the whole community benefits. One way to help build a positive community is to provide children at early learning centers access to enjoyable books.

In this Service-Learning Project, students will identify books for young children that help inspire positive feelings about themselves and their community. Then students will identify early learning centers in their community and find out how they can help children experience these books (for example, a book drive, creating e-books or audiobooks, or volunteering to read books aloud). Finally, students will create and execute a plan based on their research.

If this project has been done before, students can refer to past ideas as examples if they need help.

Project Steps
#### Investigation
Students will identify books for young children that inspire positive feelings about themselves and their community. This list of books can be created in a number of ways, including:


-  Compiling a list based on their own past experiences

-  Asking adults who may have knowledge about early learning books

-  Asking students in different classes for their opinions

-  Researching online

-  Asking a school or community librarian

Students will also investigate what resources early learning centers may be lacking by contacting early learning centers in the community. If students identify an overwhelming number of needs among local organizations, they may have to choose the most important ones for the purposes of this project.
#### Planning
Based on their investigation, students will create a plan for how they'll help children at an early learning center experience the books they've identified (for example, raising money or gathering books to donate, or helping children experience these books directly, either digitally or by volunteering at the center). This plan should include setting goals and timelines, as well as assigning roles and tasks to specific students.
#### Action
Students will put their plan into action. They'll determine the timeline or refer to the schedule part of the plan and begin. They'll also check the schedule frequently to ensure everyone is on task and meeting milestones.
#### Reflection
Students will reflect on what they've learned throughout this process, how what they've done has helped young children feel positive about themselves and their community, what challenges they faced, and how they overcame these challenges.
#### Demonstration
If the students have chosen to do something that can be observed (such as reading books aloud to children at the center), have students invite friends, family, and community members to observe them completing their project. Otherwise, have students create a presentation about their project for school staff or community members.
