#### Introduction
Present the activity: **Today we're going to watch teens and parents responding to questions about communication. You'll split into 2 groups: "teens" and "parents." Then your group will respond to discussion questions from the perspective you were assigned. **
#### Steps
1. In the list of videos, navigate to the section "Communication Conflicts." Play the video "Real Voices: What can hurt a parent-teen relationship?"
2. Have one group of students be the "parents" and the other group be the "teens."
3. Have the groups discuss the following questions from their assigned perspectives:
            
What's something you could do (or have done) that might hurt your relationship with your parent/teen?  
Why do you think that might hurt the relationship?
4. If time allows, navigate to the section "Improving Communication" and play the video "Real Voices: What can help a parent-teen relationship?"
5. Have the groups switch perspectives and discuss the following questions:
            
What's something you could do (or have done) that might help your relationship with your parent/teen?
Why do you think that would help the relationship?
6. Send parents/caregivers a link to ParenTeenConnect.org.
7. Have students and their caregivers select one of the videos to watch together and discuss, then have students report back during your next meeting.

#### Reflection
1. Have the class reflect quietly about the following prompt:

**How did it feel to take the perspective of a parent?**
2. Call on students to tell the class their ideas, as time allows.
