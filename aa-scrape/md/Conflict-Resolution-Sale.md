#### Introduction
Present the activity: **An infomercial is a commercial designed both to educate and sell a product. Today you'll work with a partner to create an infomercial to sell the idea of conflict resolution.**
#### Steps
1. Give a note card to each pair.
2. Have the pairs think of a way to peacefully resolve a conflict and write the idea on their note cards.
3. Collect the note cards and redistribute them randomly.
4. Give the pairs 10 minutes to come up with a 30-second infomercial that explains the conflict resolution idea on their note card and why people should try it.
5. Have pairs act out their infomercials, or allow students to record their infomercials and play them for the class.

#### Reflection
1. Have the class reflect quietly about the following prompt:

**Which way of resolving conflicts appealed to you most? Why?**
2. Call on students to tell the class their ideas, as time allows.
